High quality products, and the space smells amazing. A bit more social that other spas I've been too. I recommend going at a quieter time as things can get a bit noisy. Also, perhaps not the best place for modest people as the sauna is co-ed and you are just wearing a towel. Also if you have body scrubs done, you will need to leave the room to have a shower in the shared shower area by the steam room, and you will mostly naked, but covered in mud so no one can see anything (plus it's really dark) but this may bother some people.",

The available ice was a nice touch.\n\nThey were very welcoming and understanding that this was our first time visiting a spa or receiving a massage. I felt very comfortable.\n\nThe only downside was that it was kind of loud. You could hear street rumbling in the steam room. You could hear people chatting from the treatment room.  I get the street noise is unavoidable, but it would be nice to soundproof the rooms a bit more.\n\nWe will be back!",
