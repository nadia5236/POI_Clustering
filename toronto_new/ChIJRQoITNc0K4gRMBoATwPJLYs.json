I used to use the valet, but the cost has just gone up too much that it isn't worth the cost. It is cheaper to park behind the building yourself (by like $30 a night), and its a locked secure lot only accessible by the parking ticket you get.\n\nThe pics are of the King size 1-bedroom suite.",

I mean... the couch looks hard, but the cushions made me almost want to sleep there instead of the bed. Also, there is a kitchen area with one washroom within the bedroom.\n\nSo since the washroom is in the bedroom, if you're staying with friends, you'll have to keep the door open for people to pass through when they have to go. And if your friends are drunk and need to puke their brains out, give them the bed. (Just a heads up).\n\nI have stayed at this hotel about 4 times and have nothing bad to say except for the sometimes overwhelming smell of Indian cuisine on the bottom level due to the neighbouring restaurant.",
