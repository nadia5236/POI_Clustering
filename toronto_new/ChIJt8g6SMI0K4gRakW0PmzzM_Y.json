I just saw a Naturopathic Dr who gave me a list of things to buy so of course I'm going to tutti Frutti to source my prices Oct 31 2017. The man and woman who's always there she at cash he is sitting on the stool as usual She didn't like me asking the price of the products I needed she started commenting to the man in their language i could tell by the look on their faces so I stop and ask if there was a problem with her giving me the price she said I'm giving you price, i ask \"why arent you speaking english and why are you being rude and talking about me in your  language  when I've been coming to this store for so many years\"  she looked  sulky at me and then the man started yelling at me until his face was red with anger saying he's speaking Korean and can speak his language if he want. I said to him this is not the way to treat your customers had I not asked for price it would have been business as usual. It was a learning experience taking out the credit/debit cards has made us careless with our money and they know it, it's time to drop that bad habit I realize that from now on I'll make that extra effort to ask for prices before buying. I when to essence of life down the road and got my products at a better price also Baldwin Naturals prices were comparable to the price at essence of life. Thank you Tutti Frutti for turning me away from you and into a price hunter your bad behavior has shown me that I must keep the pennies in my pocket and out of yours.",
