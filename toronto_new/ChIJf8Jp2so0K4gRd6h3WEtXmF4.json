She responded with \"k\", and walked over to her co-worker, and I could hear her talking about me, saying \"get out of the store if you're not going to buy\". I walked around the store and not once did she approach me again. The manager I believe brought me into the fitting room and I ended up buying a shirt. I always wondered why this location was dead and now I know why... The girl I dealt with had brown straight hair, medium build/thin and was white. The girl she complained to me about was another white female with brown hair in a pony tail. I definitely do not recommend this location to anyone. I've never felt more pressure to buy... As for the girls... Please get out of retail. If I knew her name I would have called head office by now",
