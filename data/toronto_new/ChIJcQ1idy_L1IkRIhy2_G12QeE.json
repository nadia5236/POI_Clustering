The front staff have been very pleasant and prompt. As far as accusations of disorganization; they're running around all the time because they're always busy helping a lot of patients.

The receptionist asked me the reason that I want to see a doctor. I was at work and I told her that I am not comfortable sharing that info as I am in the office. She said she can't book an appointment for me unless I tell them the reason!
