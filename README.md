# Point-of-Interest (POI) Clustering Based on Trajectory Mining 
A set of tools to find POI-POI correlation and visualize them, based on the trajectory of moving objects. 

## Acknowledgments
This repo was helpful in writing code to fetch POIs from Google API: (https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places)

Trajectory fetching code was written with the help of Jay: (https://github.com/jaycenca/Designing-and-Developing-Algorithm)

For plotting functionality, this repo was helpful: (https://github.com/vgm64/gmplot)


### Installation
```
> pip install python-google-places
> pip install pandas
> pip install googlemaps
> pip install numpy
```

##### Code Description

> main_code_file.py: fetches POI datasets from Google API. It is the begining point to get started with running & understanding of code.

Please go to trajectory_code section to understand the working of Trajectory fetching code.
