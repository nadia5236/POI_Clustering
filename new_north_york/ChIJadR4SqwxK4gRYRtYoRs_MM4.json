He was very knowledgable and polite, and I was able to book an appointment with him for the following day. He arrived on time, clean and in uniform, introducing himself to me and also showing me his ID. \nHe thoroughly and carefully diagnosed my stove and immediately was able to let me know what the problem was. \nHe fixed my stove for a reasonable and affordable price. He was very professional. His invoice was easy to read and understand and he had a variety of methods to make a payment which I was glad for. I would and have recommended Smart-Tech Appliance Service to my friends and family or to anyone who is looking for a friendly, reliable and trustworthy technician who is knowledgeable but also passionate about what he does! \nThanks Kirk!!!",
