I am delighted with the tender care and patience that was afforded me on both of my visits. Dr. Hiutin is kind, patient, knowledgeable and caring as well as personable, AND has a megawatt welcoming smile which comes in handy any time but I think especially with being a dentist! I am put right at ease as soon as I enter their office. I trust him.  I actually looked forward to my second visit which is rare and takes a heap of trust when booking with a dentist.  Rose, the dental hygienist is always loving, kind and thorough. In fact, the whole staff is charming. Since upbeat personalities matter to me as well as expertise, I am doubly blessed. I arrived on their doorstep due to their uber great receptionist Teresa\u2019s suggestion. Teresa has been looking after me enthusiastically, kindly, lovingly and patiently for over 40 years. When one is required to go to a dentist,  it is best to go somewhere that you receive excellent care, you are made to feel that you matter, and are surrounded by caring, sunny, personalities as well as knowledgeable, expert care.  THIS IS THE PLACE!",
