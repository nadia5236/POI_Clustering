Going to court for most people is the life changing experience, you are confused, pressured by police, you don\u2019t know your legal rights, you feel absolutely powerless and afraid of being tricked out and trapped by government bureaucracy machine. My son-in-law was the client of Graham Zoppi and now, when it\u2019s all finally over, he admits that from the first meeting he had confidence in Graham's skills, felt comfortable with his analysis of the case and has no regrets for choosing Mr. Zoppi as his defence attorney. He fought our case and he won! We believe that we couldn\u2019t get a better level of legal representation.  Graham knows exactly what he is doing; his experience in criminal defence is amazing and speak for itself. I am not saying he is cheap but he is the best of the best.",
