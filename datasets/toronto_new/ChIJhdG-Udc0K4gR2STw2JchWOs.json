The roses were not fresh and barely lasted two days in water. Therefore, I contacted the store to notify them that the flowers they sold were not of good quality. The female employee I spoke to was EXTREMELY unprofessional. She would not let me speak and even started yelling on the phone. I asked for the owner of the stores contact information due to the unprofessional way the female employee was speaking to me and she stated she was not allowed to provide the owners information, which I found very strange. After getting off the phone with the female employee who was reluctant to give me her name, she proceeded to text me, which I found was an invasion of my privacy. I received no explanation for the low quality flowers and no apology for the unprofessional and unnatural behaviour from the female employee.",
