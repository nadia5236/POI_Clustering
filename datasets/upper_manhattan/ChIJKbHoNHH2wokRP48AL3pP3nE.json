Found this place on Yelp bc they do laundry cards (but you DO need cash to buy one). \n\nAwesome perk: you can \"program\" your laundry card to match your phone number, so if you leave and can't make it back for the dry cycle, they'll just call you and do it for you!\n\nMachines are $7.25/60 lbs, $5.00/30lbs, $3.00/18lbs plus $0.60 extra for soaking/extra rinse cycle. Dryers are 8 min for $0.50-$0.70 (large/xl).\n\nIt's new so nobody comes here yet and only 3 other people in here on a Saturday (!!!!) means I got 4 washers all at once. Sam, the employee working, was SO NICE and helpful, even said they can do same day wash & fold and gave me a coupon for next time. Honestly, I took a $12 cab 23 blocks up here bc of how desperate I was and it was totally, completely worth it. If you're new to NYC and think laundry is overwhelming, this place will ease your mind.",
