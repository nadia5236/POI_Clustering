Because our group is centered around good fun and fellowship we were a little disappointed that the oven didn't work. But in New York there are more than enough restaurants to choose from and that's what we did....the food was amazing.",

The customer service was excellent though. The people at the front desk and breakfast area were welcoming and the manager compensated us for the things that were not up to par. Great walking distance to restaurants and shopping.",
