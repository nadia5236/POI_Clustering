I had to leave before the doctor came in because all I had budgeted was 45 minutes as all I needed was a short conversation, some questions answered.  The assistant who took my vitals was great but had to ask me questions from memory because the system was down(?!).  When the assistant informed the doctor I had to leave, the doctor said it was \"alright\" if I had to \"reschedule.\"  I did nothing wrong and required no permission to leave or reschedule, but I insist it's not alright to be so behind schedule when people have lives to attend to.  This was the infectious disease doctor--how irresponsible to not take more care when offering a vital service to folks who are trying to manage their health and thereby the health of those around them.  My time was wasted, and I will avoid this practice in the future.",

I usually go to Planned Parenthood see the doctor get a quick test, perhaps a pap smear, get tested for all STI's, get my medication and leave. It's a lengthy process there but super thorough. I'm surprised at how bad this experience was in stark contrast to Planned Parenthood. I came told the MD and Nurse why I was there. I got my pap, which was the most painful pap smear I've ever had. I've never bleed before but I bleed for two days afterward. She was not gentle at all and basically assaulted my cervix. Even when i expressed that is was extremely painful she just said its almost over. After that she was done. She never inuired to whether I wanted to be tested for STI's or anything. Which should have been standard being that BV can present like other STIs. I never got a prescription for BV which she could have tested for via PH right then but didn't. I had to go home and wait several days without a call or a prescription. I ended up just going back to Planned Parenthood a few days later and got everything I needed. What I waste. I won't be returning for womens health, atleast not to her. Doctor Kang is wonderful but wasn't available that day.",
