The jerk chicken is spectacular, but the oxtail and the brown stew are also excellent. BBQ chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was special. Next time I might have them put the jerk sauce on the chicken, and see how that works out.\n\nEach plate comes with 2 or 3 sides. I usually get mac & cheese, cabbage, and plantains, which are all really good.\n\nI usually get a ginger infused sorrel juice with my meal. It's a terrific compliment.\n\nThe family/staff is really kind and friendly, and there's a good vibe in this nice family restaurant.",
