So I came on here to give my review of the customer service that I received on yesterday July 10,2018. The EMS workers I will not leave there names but only there badge number, because this is public. But if Captain Diman sees this badge#2689 and bashe# 2552. They showed me great caring and hospitality towards me. They was concerned about my wellbeing and wanted me to know that they will take care of me. I am well pleased with the both of them and I just wanted to let Captain Diman know I give them both 10 gold stars for what they did for me.. \nThanks again guys \u263a",
