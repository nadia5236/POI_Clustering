Now you have to go to the post office which always opens late which is inconvenient for people that have to go to work afterwards. You're soon stuck waiting on line minimally for 20 minutes while the clerks don't have a care in the world. Honestly, they should just close this place down and build something beneficial to the community (ex. daycare, affordable housing). The workers are incompetent and lazy.",

            "text": "Since I moved in across the street, I have never received a package on time. More often than that, I don\u2019t receive packages at all. This is probably the worst post office I\u2019ve ever experienced, and I\u2019ve lived a lot of places. If you\u2019re moving into the neighborhood I recommend getting a P.O. box elsewhere because this place will probably lose all of your packages.",

When I order something that has to go through this post office I know for certain I'm going to have to go pick it up myself . These are the LAZIEST \" workers \" I've ever encountered . You'll be in line for at least 20 minutes when you come here even if there are only 3 people ahead of you . The phone number doesn't work and when you come in with questions no one ever has answers. I wish I could give a quarter of a star but to be honest this place doesn't even deserve that.",
