I asked for light/medium starch on my clothes and 2 of the 7 shirts I delivered were ruined due to discolorations from applying too much starch. The remaining items were so heavily starched that I had to get them dry cleaned a second time at a different establishment to salvage them. Their prices are also higher than average and I found the service to be poor. Strongly recommend avoiding this establishment as a whole as you'll be at risk of having multiple items of clothing ruined.",
