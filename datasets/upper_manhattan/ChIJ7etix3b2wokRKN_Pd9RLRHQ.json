I was rudely approached and  prevented from going downstairs. I explained to the old female security guard that she allows me in every week with my purse and that my shirt jacket I bought with me because I was ill and cold. She pointed to the sign. I requested a Supervisor who was so rude and unprofessional. She said go home and get a sweater or don't come here. That's it I'm not going to go back and forth with you. I will never give another contribution to this place and will inform anyone else not too. I deserve an apology as medical conditions should be accommodated in any environment with good reason.",

Having frequented many other branches, albeit in more affluent neighborhoods, the library experience here at the Schomburg center is completely different. Here at this branch you are accosted by security as if one's presence in the library is questioned rather than welcomed. Unlike the other branches, it feels more disciplinary, controlled, and unwelcoming. Why is that? I am disappointed at the New York Public Library system does not offer the same Stellar service and welcoming spirit as it's other branches to encourage learning. All branches deserve this.

            "text": "The Schomburg is a wonderful place with exhibits that provide history of people of African Descent. There are amazing images and paintings which decorate the walls , but also draw the visitor in and force them to recognize the parts of the past they may not have been aware of. I was lucky enough to attend a workshop at this center where the students were given a tour of the facility, as well as presented with the opportunity to examine some historical documents and objects from the archives. All in all this experience was very enlightening and I would suggest that anyone interested in the history of people of African descent, and their contributions to the world we live in take a trip to this center. P.S. be careful of how you conduct yourself within the facility . My classmates and I were confronted by older woman who told us that we weren't behaving appropriately , and that we should \"have fun but not too much fun.\"",
