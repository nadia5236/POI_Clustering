            "text": "The sort of \u201cgreasy spoon\u201d Chinese takeout that every neighborhood should have. Cheap, fresh, and local. Cash only, not on seamless - but taking credit cards or being on seamless can take 5-20% out of a restaurant\u2019s pocket! I\u2019m fine with the trade-off when I\u2019m getting a HUGE amount of decent food in a combo platter (enough that I usually make two meals out of it!) for $8 at dinner, or $6 at lunch! \n\nOne of the things I like is that they use fresh veggies - I\u2019ve seen the owner stocking up at nearby markets! They don\u2019t have a lot of storage space, so odds are good that what they cook today, they got today (or pretty recently). Unlike some other places I\u2019ve ordered from in 15 years here, they\u2019ve never made me or anyone I know, sick. The place might be tiny and old and dingy - but they keep it clean!\n\nDon\u2019t understand some reviewers complaining about \u201cattitude\u201d on the phone. It\u2019s a lone hard-working immigrant woman handling customers at the counter, delivery riders, AND your phone calls - she\u2019s gotta keep it moving fast, and if you can\u2019t speak clearly, or have a lot of noise in the background, or try to chit-chat, you\u2019re just gonna make it harder for everyone. She can sound curt but she\u2019s never been mean or angry, and is even there with a smile when I come in to pick up! \n\nThis is the definition of bare-bones, but I mean it in the best way. Always there for you when you need cheap, quick, decent food!",
