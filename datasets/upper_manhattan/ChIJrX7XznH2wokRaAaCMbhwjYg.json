            "text": "*PLEASE READ STATEMENT COMPLETELY*\n\nIf you're the type of person who has no problem going to different hairdresser's who work in the same vicinity , you're going to have some problems. \n\nAll women who work in the shop are amazing hairdressers, I went there twice and got my hair done and I've loved my results each time. However a couple of the women who work there are constantly late for their appointments. One of these women was the person who did my hair, and because of this factor I decided to go to a different woman the second time to get my braids done because I couldn't stand waiting 1 hour and 30 minutes to 3 hours for her to come in when we both agreed to a certain time. The second time I got my braids done I went to a different hairdresser in the shop. It was very peaceful in the shop until the woman who previously did my braids arrived, she saw me sitting in the chair as the other woman was doing my braids. She then proceeded to yell in her native tongue at the woman who was doing my braids. They went back-and-forth for a solid 15 minutes and then all the other women also got involved and began yelling as well. They put me in the middle of their argument. I fully understand why she was upset , her being a hairdresser is her and her child's livelihood , but there is no excuse for that level of unprofessionalism especially in front of your patrons and their children. She could've easily spoke to her after everything else was said and done rather than acting out on emotion alone. They were both either in their late 30s or well into their 40s, i've only seen children act like this in a professional setting. I'm sure they're not bad people but they aren't exactly the most professional. ",
