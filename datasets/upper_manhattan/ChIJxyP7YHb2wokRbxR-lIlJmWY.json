Do yourself and your love ones a favor as well and don\u2019t go there.They have no bedside manners and many of their credentials and liscense should be question. The things that the employees do here is completely unacceptable and disgusting. The staff there is horrible and unprofessional from the doctors, nurses, and police officers. There so many things that this place screwed up on while my kid was admitted here that it would take me a day to list them all. Last to say the least when I called them out on what they weren\u2019t doing they had the nerve to call ACS on me for medical negligence because I asked for my kid to be transferred to another hospital that would actually treat her. So go at your own risk. This hospital should be shut down and some of the staff should be stripped of their liscense and fired. And the hospital administrator she should be fired as well.",

            "text": "I was a patient at this hospital many times and I regret coming here but I did my weight loss surgery here so I thought the best thing to do is to come here for everything else I have to do because they know me... But it's so sad to say this is the worst hospital I been too. I am no longer coming here even if I am dying. I appreciate all the work people in this hospital have done for me  but it needs to change. When you are here it feels like am bothering employees to help me do their jobs. Some of the staff take this job as a job not as a career. I was in the 11th floor they are under staff and they have to pull double shifts. That will make a person in this place really upset. At night this place looks like a horror film. You can hear screams for nurse assistance. All the nurse feel that they are rushed. They become very aggressive when you try to ask them for ICE. Imagine you have to ask for medicine. If you have fluid drains from surgery learn how to work with them before you come here the lack of attention  without draining them will get them clogged. If this happens and it happend to me you will have to for to ER and you will have to wait 6 hours because they dont it. They have to wait for a surgeon to try to unclog the problem. The ER is a very special place where they love to pass patients around like musical chairs to many different departments. I spend 4 hours in the bed and nothing is happening lots of staff need some training in some customer service and some need to learn how to be human instead of robots. There is so much gossip in the ER they should have their own show. There is a big issue with the beds. They deflate all the time.. Also if the patient is or was a bariatric weight loss patient please please get that person a better bed and all ready his meals should be  low calorie diet. The food at this hospital is worst then at a homeless shelter. I never felt comfortable not one Bit here.. I spoke with a lady that works with patients to help with patients needs and concerns. This didnt help at all... Everyone here knows the problem but give it a blind eye. No one is looking for a solution to help the problem... it's sad that 90% of the staff is here for a pay check. Take this info how the reader likes but this hospital needs to change and many patients need to change also. We all can be better people if we try.  I am happy to say I will no longer come to this hospital and I been through a tough time. Remember Harlem hospital we dont want you to be a friendly hospital we want you to help people get better with a professional attitude.",
