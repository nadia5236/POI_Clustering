The past three times I've gone in there is always some issue this evening it was the computer systems were down and they were trying to do it old school the way actually I used to do when I was a kid at McDonald's and they were unable to communicate with each other therefore they had a lot of customers who were stopping for breakfast throwing up their hands and disgusting just walking out. If it's not the employees complete lack of professionalism that is going on it's so late night Riff Raff and crackheads who go in to the bathroom to use their drugs fit end up creating some kind of kerfuffle so my best advice is to stay away from this unit anytime after 11 it's better two-way and go down to the unit on the 120s in Broadway. The staff is nasty as hell but at least they get their jobs done I've got location. I guess you overall message to anybody in the Harlem area is it's better to go down in a plane crash then to deal with one of these units after midnight.",
