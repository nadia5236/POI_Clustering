He was having issue with his feet and I was expecting a huge vet bill and some scratches as he\u2019s a nervous cat. Dr. Butler is a genius with animals, he instantly felt comfortable with her and barely needed to be held for his exam. She was thorough, explained everything to me, and genuinely seemed to care for him. She even gave me lists of products to avoid and cat foods. It was a great experience overall. I\u2019ll be taking both my cats there from now on to see Dr Butler",
