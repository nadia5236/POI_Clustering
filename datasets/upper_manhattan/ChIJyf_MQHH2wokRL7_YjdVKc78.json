No power in the electrical outlets + no one at the front desk.\n\nWhen I arrived around 10:20pm on a Friday, I waited at the front desk for 20 minutes but no one showed up. I went to the security guard and she said that the front-desk employee would still be on break for another 15min. What?!\n\nAlso, there was no power in the electrical outlets in my room! Either night! Unbelievable. And, I was going to a Saturday all-day event and so went out at 7:40am and the front desk was closed, so I was unable to tell anyone. That's not that early, so there's really no excuse for the desk to be closed then.\n\nAdditionally, if you like to satisfy the human desire of thirst, too bad. They offered no options for drinking water. I went down to the front desk and asked where I could find a cup for tap water and they told me I'd have to go to the corner store to buy a cup. Are you kidding me?!",
