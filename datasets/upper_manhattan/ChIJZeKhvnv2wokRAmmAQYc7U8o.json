Despite 3 treatments she was still suffering but after 2 hours with Wanda she came back fluffy and clean. We found a few fleas on her face some days after but haven't seen any since 4 days now after her bath. While my cat loudly protested during the bath and grooming she didn't commit the usual revenge acts in our home like she often does when she feels angry after a vet visit. That goes a long way to show how well Wanda treated Kimora my japanese bobtail. I highly recommend her services, its worth the cost.",

            "text": "While Wanda was professional, the day I took my two dogs, the person doing the washing and grooming was not her, but a large man.  When we went to pick up our dogs, the first thing he yelled out to us from the back of the store was \"your dog bit me!\". First of all, my dog is a teacup shih tzu weighing about 7lbs,. I have never seen him bite anyone, but since he was in a place were two strangers are dealing him and possibly hurt him while he was being de-tangled/groomed, I'm not sure why he is in that line of work. My brother in law is a vet and has been bitten many times by dogs, but he doesn't cry like a big baby or yell at the customer. Thankfully he understands it's part of the job.  This man behaved as if we offended him, or the dog attacked him for no reason, but based on his size, one would think a nip from a tiny dog wouldn't ruin his life. I also hated his cut. I asked her to keep most of his beard full, but the way they shaped it, he ended up with a thin long beard (about 1\" wide) that almost touched the floor.  I have not been back to Wanda's since, and don't plan to ever patronize that business again.  There's just certain ways customers should be treated, so I give this place 2 stars.",
