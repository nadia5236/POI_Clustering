This location is very elegant and well-kept, unfortunately I needed something closer to downtown.\n\nEven though I voiced these concerns to the superintendent Tonia she still was extremely warm and welcoming and answered any questions I had about the building and the general GTA area. \n\nI really appreciated the respect she showed me (even though I showed up late because I got lost), she showed me the whole building in case it could work for me and didn't make me feel like a waste of time (Since I told her upfront I was looking for something closer downtown and am not from the area) ,the honesty about the area (the good and the bad lol) and her openness were well received. \n\nI wish I worked closer to the area because each apartment rented is remodeled, new appliances and the building faces forests so there is a beautiful peaceful view.",

The buildings are not cleaned and maintenance repairs not completed in timely manner.
