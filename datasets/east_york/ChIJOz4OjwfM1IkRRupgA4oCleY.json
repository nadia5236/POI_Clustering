The other staff were very accommodating. I'm self employed and I recognize that they legitimately put their hearts into their work. I felt very confident that I bought the best boots for the money I spent. They carry brand names that aren't cheap but will last. I bought four pairs and will go there from now onstore.

Within a month, they developed a defect where the rubber outer layer started to separate from the neoprene, likely due to poor adhesion. I brought the boots back upon request after giving the store a call. This was on Sunday. They asked me to leave them overnight so the manager can take a look on the following day. I don't get them back until Thursday after they decided, with blessings from \"head office\", that the boots aren't defective and told me to come back if it gets worse. 1. Their decision should've been made on the spot. 2. I contacted BOGS' own customer service people with a description of the problem and a photo and they agreed that it's a defect and are sending me a replacement pair. Dealing with Walking On A Cloud has been a waste of time.\n",
