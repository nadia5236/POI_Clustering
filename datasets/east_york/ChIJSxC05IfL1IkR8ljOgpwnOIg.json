I wish the prices weren\u2019t too steep, but other than that it\u2019s quite a nice experience! \nIf I remember correctly, when you get placed to a table, you come to the front (or they give it to you) and get a marker pen and a mini white board! You decide in your heart\u2019s content and bring it to the front counter and they bite it down and give you a tall flag with a number. You wait until fresh hot food comes at your table! After that l, you take the flag back anytime you want to order something new or when paying! The staff were great in refilling our waters! And when we still had food remaining after our stay there, and when we asked, they were great at bringing take out boxes so we could take our leftover portions home! \nIt was quite a new little experience and was quite fun!",

It's amazing for a quick bite and amazing for a good lunch. They have recently upgraded the interior and they added another floor to accommodate more people. It does get busy on the weekend so make sure you come knowing there might be a wait. Options include rice of several kind. BBQ items from the grill. A wide range of gravies and vegetarian options. Definitely worth the visit to this place.",

If you want to eat your meal in a crazy loud, kids crying, people yelling, barely any room to breath environment then this is the place for you. The food is good but not mind blowing. The hype has brought this brand far. But it is not worth the time, money or peace of mind to eat in a place so chaotic during busy periods. There are plenty of places with similar food quality where you can eat in peace.",
