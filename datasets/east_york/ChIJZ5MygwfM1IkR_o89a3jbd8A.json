I mean who doesn't love going down to the beaches? \nClean, comfortable and easy to go through items (not jam packed like other places are where everything falls to the floor just by touching something on a rack)  \nLast but DEF not least, the girls that work there are very helpful and most of all they are very friendly and inviting, easy to talk with. Like an old friend u haven't seen in some time, which ends up making the experience what it is, a great one!  Highly recommend this place. Won't disappoint!  \ud83d\ude01",

I don\u2019t have any family and I do not have any females in my life. The customer service is brutal and I will never recommend or buy anything here in the future.",
