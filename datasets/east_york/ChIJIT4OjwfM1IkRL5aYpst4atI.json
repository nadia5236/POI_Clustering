While I was buying they gave me a scratch card and it revealed 20% discount. To which I told the person preparing my order to increase the order to 150gms of the same tea. She packed two separate bags of the same tea, one for 100gm and another for 50gm. After I paid I noticed that she applied discount on the 50gms tea. I asked about it and she told me that their system applies the discount to the lesser tea.  Since, i already paid i didn't bother to argue but its not acceptable as it was the same tea only. The associate even though knowing their system works like this still processed it as two separate teas. WHAT A POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. To me it looks like she had no common sense and no desire of offering proper customer service.",

The girls are so excited to tell me, did I mention they are special needs. It is such a relief to know there is a safe place where they can go daily. \r\nWhen I come down to visit I have quite a list of things to buy and wish to say thank you to the wonderful staff for their patience and understanding with my sisters.\r\n Kudos to this exceptional store, which is the staff plus great product.  \r\n",
