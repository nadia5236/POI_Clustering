She was referred to Sarah Wong by a dermatologist, to have her mole removed. Sarah Wong referred my daughter back to the dermatologist, said that the dermatologist didn't send her any information, and she can't believe what we said. we know what she said was a lie, because I called the dermatologist the second day. \nShe is a money sucker. She didn't want to remove the dysplastic mole for medical preventative reason but she wants to charge $600 to remove my daughter's normal mole.",
