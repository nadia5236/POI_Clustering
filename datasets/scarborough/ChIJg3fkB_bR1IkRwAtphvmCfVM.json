Principal has no knowledge of English. Washrooms are so bad. Students were asked to bring toilet rolls. I consider it my civic duty to warn others- this school is horrible. poor leadership is an understatement. Teachers are bias to certain kids specially \"Arab speaking\".  I would ask every parent to think twice before enrolling to this school. This is a failing school.",

One of the things that stood out was every morning the school would come together in the gymnasium to do the morning adhkaar. If you are wondering the kind of school this is just come in the morning and you will be able to see the order and love for Islam. I will miss the school very much as I felt like I was part of a large family.",
