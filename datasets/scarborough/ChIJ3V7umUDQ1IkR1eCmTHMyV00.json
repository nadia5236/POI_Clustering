Next was the consultation with the Orthodontist. Then pictures, imaging, moulds, plus a good reassuring talk and a bright smile from Melissa. \n\nSue then takes over and tells you about her life like you are family all while taking  authentic care of you with finesse.\n\nFinally the Orthodontist, in my case Corinne Haiat, takes over, and with precise skill turns the bad and the ugly into a work of art. \n\nA real genuine team effort. The care goes on until you are completely satisfied. Amazing, thank you all!\n\nIt is never too expensive to make you and your loved ones feel great about themselves.\n\nWith thanks,\nKristan",
