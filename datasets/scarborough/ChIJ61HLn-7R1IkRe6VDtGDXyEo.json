They told me that they take $1000 deposit, if they can't find the problem they will return the $1000.  At 1st they said it was the starter, I purchased the part, they then told me it was a wiring problem. I told them that I will just take my truck back. They did not want to give me my deposit back. After arguing they said they can give only $300 back. So basically I lost $700, I was unable to return the unused starter, so I lost another $200. Plus they did nothing to help with my truck.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS SERVICE, THEY ARE SCAMMERS. THEY LURE YOU IN, RIP U OFF AND LEAVE YOU IN DEBT!!!!! DO NOT COME HERE!!",
