The regulars who go there are also very friendly and inclusive - there is a big community feel, where everyone wants to help everyone else get better. There is a good variety of classes to take once you've got the basics down, and the drop-in games are always fun and competitive. This is the place to go if you want to get quality coaching while making friends at the same time!",

Their classes really sharpen up your game, and the constant advice and criticism given by the coaches really make a difference. They have a tier system that lets you play with people of the same skil level, and it encourages you to do better each time you show up. The Ronin Rumble (A drop in-esque system) is one of the best volleyball experiences I've had in my volleyball career. Keep up the good work Kanitha!",
