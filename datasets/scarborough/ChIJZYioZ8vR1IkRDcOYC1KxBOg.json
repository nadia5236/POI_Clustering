I had other conditions and wanted to see her because I was so sure she could help me with the other problems too. The only problem was the receptionist or the assistant that takes calls. I left a voicemail couple of times to get a follow up appointment (which was before it\u2019s been a year from the first appointment) but no one got back to me. So I tried again recently even though it was over a year and so I was told I need a referral. I do understand I need a referral so I would\u2019ve got one but the receptionist was so rude, while I was asking a question, she hung up on me and had an attitude for no reason. I was not going to anyone else because I wanted to see Dr Hessami only but the assistant or whoever that takes calls was probably having a bad day, I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care but it was still disappointing and I felt insulted and disrespected that she was rude and hung up while I was talking. And just because I don\u2019t wanna deal with her face and attitude in the front desk, I have to start looking for another dermatologist now.",
