He has an easy going personality, and welcomes clients to follow him as he inspects the home they are contemplating purchasing.  He answers their questions, and explains any concerns he finds, or what to watch for in the future. He reviews the report with them in detail to ensure they understands every aspect of the report.  I would highly recommend Ray and Housemaster Home Inspection to any Buyer looking to purchase a home with an honest and professional inspector.",
