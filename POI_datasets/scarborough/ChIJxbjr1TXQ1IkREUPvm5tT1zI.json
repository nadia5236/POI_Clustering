She does not speak English fluently so I help her arrange for service. The technicians are friendly, patient, and clean. This is very important for my mom -- a little, old, doubtful, and timid \u201cneat freak\u201d. The pricing is always fair. They respond quickly and are polite and professional. They really take time to answer your questions to help you understand your situation and give you your options. They make sure you are happy and comfortable with the work they are doing. \n\nAir Flex was recommended to me by a friend. Now our own experiences have earned Lindon and his team our trust. I highly recommend Air Flex!",
