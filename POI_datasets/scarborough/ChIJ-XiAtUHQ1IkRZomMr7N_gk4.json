She does all the leg work, tel. calls, including queuing up for me herself to wait for my cash while I sit in her office, but most importantly... She listened and was very empathetic of my emotional state and my entire tale of woe! NOW, THAT IS GREAT SERVICE, AND P.R... THX, ANA! AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE RUBBING OFF ON THE REST OF THE STAFF...
