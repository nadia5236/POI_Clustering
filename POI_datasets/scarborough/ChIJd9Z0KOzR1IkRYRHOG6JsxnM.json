            "text": "Recently bought a used pickup truck off kijiji and the seller used this mechanic to safety the vehicle. It was my first vehicle so I didn't think to get a pre-purchase inspection. Anyways, after I registered the truck I took it to my own mechanic who said it shouldn't have passed the inspection. I went to MTO who sent a rep down and verified that the passenger airbag and emergency brake weren't working, and also that there was a large hole the size of two fists in the driver side floor pan and the cradle for the radiator was too rusty to pass the safety as well. It would have been about $2500 in repairs so the MTO officer got the mechanic to reimburse me for what I paid for the truck and the seller towed it back the same day. It was unfortunate to encounter such a dishonest person but at least I learned a lot about vehicles!",
