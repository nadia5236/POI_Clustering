All the Stylists are so so friendly, helpful, kind and professional. There is a warm and friendly feeling in the shop and everyone is treated with love and respect. Auntie V did my hair and even though my hair was really short and silky she gripped it with no problem, I\u2019ve have never had my hair braided without zero pain, it literally felt like a head massage, I almost fell asleep! She was so sweet and so good, she went above and beyond and she was so gentle and skilled, my braids still look fresh and feel strong. I was there for about 6hrs and I never saw anyone take a break longer than a few minutes, every stylist kept helping customer after customer with skill and smiles. There is a lot of fun and jokes while you are being helped so no chance of being bored either. I would come back here again and again without fail.",
