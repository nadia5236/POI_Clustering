He said her oxygen tube was under her head.  What the hell???  He went to the nurse station and explained what happened.  Nurse told him \u201cyour grandma stopped breathing an hour ago\u201d What the hell???  Either these nurses have not passed there course or the workers in the hospital disgustingly don\u2019t care!!!  My grandma most likely was struggling for air like over an hour and nobody called code BLUE?!  No one should have to die this way.  From the moment I stepped into this hospital I could sense and feel the coldness of the atmosphere.  Advice, if you want to live drink green smoothies, but if you want to die, just go there.",

            "text": "My wife was suffering from a high fever and was shaking uncontrollably. The doctor instructed her to stay overnight in the emergency waiting area until she was stabilized. The Doctor later instructed a nurse to take my wife's temperature and the nurse flat out refused. The nurse told the doctor that she had taken my wife's temperature too many times and was not going to do it again. The Doctor did not take any further action. \n\nLater in the night my wife was still shaking due to the high fever - a nurse told her \"to stop acting like that\" and that she [my wife] would get in \"a lot of trouble\" if a \"code blue has to be called\". \n\nAbsolutely ridiculous hospital with vicious death squad nurses. Use this hospital's emergency as an absolute last resort. If you're ever unlucky enough to visit this hospital then make records of all nurse interactions and note their names. If you experience a similar situation call the Hospital's Patient Advocacy as soon as you can.",
