There are fields for practically every sport, baseball, football, soccer, basketball courts, handball courts, volleyball courts, etc. Some fields are in pristine condition, others are well-maintained.\n\nThe playground area is huge and offers a lot of entertainment for kids of all ages. There is also a water feature area and the entire playground section is fenced in with benches around the outside as well as in the middle which is wonderful.\n\nBathrooms are located next to the major areas, playgrounds, baseball fields, etc.\n\nThere is a big pond that you can walk around. No bikes or scooters on that path, which is a bit disappointing, but makes for a nice walk. The pond has lots of fish, turtles and geese. There is also a food/ice cream cafe building located adjacent to the pond. \n\nTons of activities to do here. Bring your sports equipment or a bicycle and spend tons of time. There are also people who opt to barbecue in the grass area. Definitely somewhere that you can spend several hours on a nice day.",
