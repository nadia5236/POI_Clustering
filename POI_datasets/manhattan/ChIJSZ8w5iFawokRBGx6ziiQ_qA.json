In ENGLISH!!! I mean REALLY? Whats the point? I quit at the end of the semester, they charged $200 for not doing registration for next semester. Really? Of course I didn't pay them at that time. After few years, there had been a $200 credit in my credit report since the year I left this garbage school. It was ruining my credit for that long!!! This is absolutely a scam school.

School is not accredited anywhere so don't think to transfer.. Even if you think about transferring after getting a associates your credits won't transfer so don't waste your time nor money here... Football players stay in many different locations over paying for housing living with 7+ teammates in a 3 bedroom house.. Everybody is dependent on there own for food the school doesn't help with food in any kind of way.. You go to globe pay 3,000$ for housing and that's just to have somewhere to sleep regular schools about 3,000$ for room and board where they feed you as well unlike globe.. The players have to travel at least 1hr-2hr to get to practice or just to class school doesn't help with traveling either.. Everybody hates it and transfer after one semester just to hear news they credits does not transfer.. This school is just a money scheme school who more people needs to take a harder look at",
