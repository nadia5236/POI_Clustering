It appeared to be a permanent dimple in my collar to which I then show the owner who was there at the time. He not only denied responsibility but was a complete jerk about it. It was a brand new shirt and expensive. I explained that to the owner who snapped back with saying, \"so what, I have clients here with much more expensive shirts than that.\"  What did that have anything to do with my specific situation?  Jerk. I took my business elsewhere and sadly, the Korean/Chinese cleaners on the corner of Clinton and East Broadway had since retired. They were flawless and awesome, but so long as the owner continues to manage this place, he would never see a dime from my business again. ",
