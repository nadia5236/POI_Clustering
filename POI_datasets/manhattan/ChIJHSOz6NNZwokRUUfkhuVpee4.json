The staffs are nice people but considering that they have too many dogs here without a compatible amount of staffs taking care, your dog might not receive enough attention. I brought my dog home after a week of boarding and she\u2019s having a diarrhea and starts vomiting right on our way home. She also looks completely worn out due to extreme lack of good rest. All these the staffs didn\u2019t even mention a word to me when I called them to ask how my dog is doing. If your dog is super active and you\u2019re just looking for a daycare during the week, it\u2019d be a better choice than as a boarding service.\n\nUpdate: this is the second day that I brought my dog home after the boarding and for at least 24 hours she doesn\u2019t want to eat any solid food although being lethargic and inactive. I have no idea what she\u2019s been through during her stay but this is definitely not right. I now feel so terrible and regret so much for sending her there. Please don\u2019t even try to let your dog stay on board at this place because I\u2019m pretty sure they will only contact you when your dog is dead (and there\u2019s no refund).",

Then one day I was walking her on 20th St and found Citipet. Amazing place. Bright and natural light shines right in. My dog loves it and wants to stay when I go pick her up at night... Staff is super friendly owners are Brazilians and super friendly. I recommend!!!",

            "text": "Our puppy stayed at Citipet Playhouse for 8 days and we were horrified during her stay and when we picked her up. The facilities are dirty and minimal. The staff is clueless. We called internationally to check on our puppy while away and were unable to ascertain any information, including whether she was being given her medicine; they were non-responsive on the phone when trying to have a conversation and even hung up on us.  \n\nOur puppy gained 2 pounds in 8 days.  When we picked her up I asked how many times per day they fed her and was told 3x/day although I provided explicit, handwritten instructions directing them to feed her 2x/day, per our vet.  The staff tried to back track and lie to cover themselves for deviating from the instructions; however, the weight gain and their admission speak volumes. \n\nAdditionally, we brought medication that was not returned and the items that were returned after a 20 minute search, including her collar which was removed, were damaged with something dry and sticky on them.  Our puppy was returned to us filthy- she had a terrible odor and her hair was matted.  The first thing we did was put her right in the bath when we got home.\n\nThis is not a place you want to bring your puppy!",
