I fell in love with his photojournalistic style as soon as I saw his photos online, but still the photos he captured of our elopement in New York City were more beautiful than I could have imagined. Sascha uses his knowledge of architecture to take his photography to the next level and give you not only stunning photos, but gorgeous keepsakes of the city. I received so many compliments on our photos and everyone adored his unique style. Working with Sascha was the smartest decision we made while planning our intimate wedding. Our tour around New York City with Sascha was one of the most fun parts of our day. He knows the city extremely well, is hilarious to talk to, and is willing to do anything (even step into traffic and run through a marathon) to get a great shot. Since we were planning our elopement from out of state, he was extremely helpful in referring us to hair and makeup stylists, floral recommendations, etc. He is so fun and joyful to be around on your special day, no matter the event. So just say yes!",
