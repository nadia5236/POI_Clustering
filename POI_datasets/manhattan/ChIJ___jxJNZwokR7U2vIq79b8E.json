He took the time to make sure every item was clean and precisely set up. When drawing out my tattoo, he always made sure that I liked everything before he continued. Eddy went above and beyond with the detail and made the lighthouse even better than I had hoped for! He really cared about my opinion and used that to give me the best artwork possible. The tattoo at any place else would have cost me a fortune but he really gave me an incredible price. If I am to get another tattoo in the future, I am going back to Eddy! Soon he is selling items of artwork and I cannot wait to purchase that as well! 10/10 would recommend. There is truly no better artist who is as talented and humble as this man!",
