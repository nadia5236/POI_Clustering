This was a bucket list item for my wife, a new tradition for us as a couple. Mario my artist went above and beyond to accomadate for the tattoo I was looking for. He stayed later than normal and did not complain one bit. If you ever go I highly recommend Mario. My wife got a tattoo from Young and he was on POINT! She didn't want anything too big for her first and I figured being small that the detail would not be as good as a bigger tattoo. I was WRONG he did an amazing Job and so quickly. I would give 10 stars anyday. Trust me if you go somewhere else you will regret it! Thank you so much for making our memories happen the way you did!",

I made an appointment two weeks in advance and sent the image of what I wanted, but when I showed up the outline wasn\u2019t drawn and I had to wait an hour. Additionally, this shop doesn\u2019t change by the hour, they just make up random quotes of how much an tattoo will charge, which is unfair to person paying. Finally, my tattoo faded like crazy, and I took amazing care of it. I can\u2019t believe I went here and paid a significant amount of money for an especially faded tattoo!",
