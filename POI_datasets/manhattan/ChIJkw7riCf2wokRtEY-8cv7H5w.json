I always thought acupuncture might be a bit woo woo but I was a bit desperate. After just 2 sessions my insomnia improved dramatically. Within by the 4th session my chest pains almost disappeared entirely. Now 5 months later I still go for treatment once or twice a month and haven't felt this good in a long time. \n\nEven got to use my FSA card:)",

Her approach is the antithesis of cookie-cutter: she makes sure to really understand your situation and custom-tailors her treatments to individual circumstances and needs with rare discernment, insight and precision. \n\nI continue to see Janna regularly for maintenance, and look forward to each and every treatment. I\u2019ve experienced acupuncture with excellent practitioners before, and yet I consider myself extremely lucky to be in her care and would absolutely recommend Janna and White Sage Acupuncture to those who consider their physical as well as emotional health a priority.",
