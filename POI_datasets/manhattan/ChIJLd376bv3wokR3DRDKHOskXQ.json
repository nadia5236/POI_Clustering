I understood there would be issues here and there, but i never expected to deal with this kind of irresponsibility. So far we've had to deal with no warm water, electricity being shut off, fire alarms going off for no reason, the vents in the kitchen do not ventilate during cooking so smoke accumulates, both elevators stop working and you must figure out a way to go up 11 floors with your groceries, we barely get packages delivered to our apartment because they keep them in the management office which is only open 9-5 or they get lost. The walls were just painted and theyre already stained all over. The place looks good superficially but it's a piece of \ud83d\udca9. ",
