Unfortunately the experience did not go as planned to say the least. I have to be careful when going to new restaurants because I have a nut allergy. I always make sure to inform my server once I arrive as I did with this experience as well. I was assured that there would be no nuts. The night was going great so far. We ordered many appetizers and as I was eating them something didn\u2019t taste right. I instantly knew what was happening. There were nuts. I informed the people with me what was happening and informed my server. I ordered more water to see if it would go down but unfortunately it did not. I started to feel very sick and at the point of passing out. So I excused my self and left to get medicine. Unfortunately the night did not end the way I had hoped or expected and after this experience I don\u2019t feel safe returning to this restaurant knowing that this very well could happen again.",
