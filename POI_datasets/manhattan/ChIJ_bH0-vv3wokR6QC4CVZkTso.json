If you want to enjoy the experience of buying a new car and be happy this is not the place for you, however if you'd like to get disrespected and treated like a piece of garbage after purchasing 4 vehicles in 2 years then by all means this is the place for you and more specifically Nissan in hillside nj on rt 22. The customer service is horrific from the beginning to end! I could go into detail but it might take me 3 months like it takes them to fix a vehicle and completely frustrate you in the process and then offer you 50 dollars worth of more horrible service....please do not waste your time, money or happiness here.",

I was told by ROBBIE the service manager that my car wasnt covered by my warranty.So i couldnt be reimbursed my $300.for defected spark plugs on a vehicle that i only had 7months. The coporate manager called me (Howard Newman)after i filled complaint on rt 22 honda website. And nothing was done to get my money back. ALL he cared about was my terrible review. I think the lawsuit they  had about false advertising  pricing as well as selling cars with issues aka lemons not certified at all needs to be reopened again. Im scared that something will happen with my vehicle and i will have to come out of pocket because thier defected products and cars. SMH.......STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALER.......",
