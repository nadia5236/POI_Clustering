After spending an hour on the phone with a supervisor I find out the what we were told over 3 years ago was not true and that basically any call that we've made into the customer service since opening the account was never documented on the file.  When I asked the supervisor why the customer is now having to be paying the consequences of their company not doing their job, he could only say 'oh I'm sorry'.  I asked him if that sounded like good customer service he said \"well no\" but offered no form of resolution.   This company lies, misleads, and misinforms their clients.  They don't document accounts properly, and offer no sign of customer appreciation.",
