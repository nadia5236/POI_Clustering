Lazy, dishonest and totally uninterested in getting your packages to you. The office itself is filthy and the lines stretch out the door most days as the workers don't move at all.  THey can never find the packages despite the notices and tracking number.  I have tried to pick up packages that were already returned to the seller as the notices are delivered weeks late.  People who wonder why USPS is dying while FedEx is thriving should stop by this office.  We now always specify that packages be sent by FedEx, but when they can't, around 1/2 the packages never get delivered despite the notices they leave stating otherwise.  Today I got a notice dated 10 days ago stating this was a final attempt to deliver.  Totally dishonest- I have a distinct feeling someone is just taking the packages home and dropping off a notice when they feel like it.  A disgrace.",

One your package winds up here it's stuck in this black hole...[edit: total wait time 45 minutes for package pickup. I was customer 4 in that time...]\n\nUpdate: There's also no machine here. Most other post offices have self serve machines so you can at least buy postage, self stamp packages etc. Just to buy stamps you have to wait in a crazy line!

Go through UPS or FedEx, and at least your packages will be delivered to your door in the time they promised. I should send them a bill for delivering my own shipment to myself.",

Not only do the office workers don't care about their customers, BUT they don't even have an active phone number to call. The website gives a number that is disconnected, AND when I contacted the general USPS office they gave me their \"updated one\" (but warned me that they NEVER answer) and when I called.... BIG SURPRISE. the updated phone number is disconnected!!!!! THIS IS A GOVERNMENT FUNDED PROGRAM THAT SHOULD NOT BE ACTING  THIS WAY!!!!! RIDICULOUS. I SHOULD SUE THEM FOR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS.",
