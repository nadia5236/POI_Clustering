I have been looking for a good natural hair salon since moving up north and traveled quite a bit to come here based on the reviews I saw.  I recently took out my braids prior to the appointment and I can admit I will need a trim soon.  However, I came for a perm rod set and a deep condition and my hair has never felt drier.  Knowing I am about ready for a trim, I was expecting some single strand knots at the ends.  But my hair as a whole felt like straw, and that has NEVER happened to me before.  I\u2019m not sure if my hair was not agreeing with the products, but I was shocked to wake up the next day and feel how dry it felt.  Also, the rod set lasted one day before turning into a frizzy mess.  Especially as a student, I have to be very strategic about how and where I spend my money; I honestly regret how much I spent for the results.  The only reason I am giving two stars is because the people were generally kind and it seems like a great place to go for locs.  Unfortunately, I will not be recommending here for regular natural hair care.",
