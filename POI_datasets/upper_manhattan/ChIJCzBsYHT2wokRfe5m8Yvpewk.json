I'm not into energy shots but after reading the ingredient list I figured why not, sounds good. I love trying natural things. Literally like 5 minutes after taking the shot I felt refreshed. For the rest of the day that icky feeling didn't come back. I had actually forgotten that I even took the shot! That's how good I felt. If you need a quick pick me up this is definitely something you want to try. And what I especially love and appreciate is the lack of preservatives and additives. Oh and it tastes pretty good too :))",

I am aware that those drinks are very high in sugar content and was looking for a healthier alternative that was just as effective. I gave Energy Juice a try, and it was amazing. No chemical-infused energy drinks were necessary that night! The taste is quite strong, but definitely worth it. After 30 minutes, I felt very awake. The biggest difference I would say is that with this drink, it awakens the MIND so your body feels very light. Therefore, your body does not physically feel a \"crash\" like one would with a typical energy drink. I would say overall, the drink allowed me to get through a 8 hour shift in top condition. Would recommend to anyone!",

I went from having zero energy to feeling as if I had slept for hours on in and I didn't crash either, which was the most amazing part of my experience. It also taste wonderful! I'll never drink any other energy drinks again unless it's Mawu Lisa!",

And the Energy tonic is my favorite, because I work late nights and love having a natural, healthier alternative to too much coffee at work! These products are delicious and are essential for anyone who has a busy life style and cares about what they put in their body.  This is as natural as it get! Would highly recommend to everyone!",
