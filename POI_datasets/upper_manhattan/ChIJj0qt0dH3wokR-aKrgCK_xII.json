My Hoboken friends all say \"his cost and attitude are unacceptable\". His assistant asked me to allow filming and photos to be done during my laser facial and I agreed on the condition the Doctor would remove a stitch that is ingrown into my skin. Doc said \"yes that would only take a minute, sure, you have a deal\" and then after the proceedure he said he ran out of time and would do it free of charge another time. To this day he refuses to keep his word and wanted to charge $600 for that even though he agreed to do it in exchange for the free PR on my instagram page that has almost 9,000 followers. Like they say: A man is ONLY as good as his word. Let that sink in.",

But being 31, I knew it was time to look into some facial care. Then I met who I now call \u201cDr. K\u201d! He\u2019s extremely kind, honest (tell it like it is), professional, personable, and is an expert in his field. I had Botox in my forehead and crows feet, and then filers in my cheeks. And Oh my goodness I kid you not, I look at LEAST 24-25!!! I feel SO hot and I am a huge fan of these preventative measures and it\u2019s done by the best!! I love Dr. K so much, that even though I\u2019m moving to Baltimore, I will make the 3 hour trip back religiously because he\u2019s got a fan in me for life!!! Thank you Dr. K!! You truly are a talented individual! I wish I could post a picture because this review doesn\u2019t do the beauty I feel justice!! I highly recommend and go to his YouTube testimonial page for more live reviews!!",
