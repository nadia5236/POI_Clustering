Now, less than a year later it\u2019s up to a $30 min! No notice was given to me. They simply upcharge me. And I checked their website and I see no mention of this on their pricing schedule. I also emailed them to ask them directly and heard nothing back. It\u2019s a sleazy practice and I\u2019m looking for another service, sadly.",

They have also customized pick up times for me beyond what's offered on their app, when I've been going on vacation for example - I just emailed and asked.

There is absolutely NO way that my laundry weighed that much. Deciding to weigh it myself, it came out to 18 pounds. That sounds far closer to my typical weight.
