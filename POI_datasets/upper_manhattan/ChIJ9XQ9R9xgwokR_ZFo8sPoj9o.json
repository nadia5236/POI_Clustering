            "text": "My daughter and I came to this office this morning and were mistreated by staff. I called the office and told them I was running late about 10 minutes. When I finally arrived, the medical assistant said, he would have to reschedule. He put me in for the next available appointment. Unfortunately, I forgot the insurance card and told the gentlemen to call the insurance company to verify eligibility. He refused to contact my daughter's insurance company and told me that it was my responsibility. While I was on the phone with them, he said I would have to reschedule because the paper work was not filled out in time. It was only 3 minutes. I asked to speak to the doctor and was told no by the medical assistant. I left my contact info on a post it and asked him to give it to her. He told me that my daughter was not a patient and I did not have an appointment. Therefore, she does not have to see her. The medical assistant then told me that he can reschedule the appointment and he would be right back. I got on the phone with my daughter\u2019s insurance company to go see another doctor. While in the lobby waiting on the phone, six police officers came in. They asked me is there an altercation or brawl. I told them no and I was waiting for the medical assistant to come back out. He never came back out and the police officer went inside the office. The officer came back out and told me I would have to reschedule another appointment. The cops were shocked and dismayed about being called for nothing. REALLY!!!! My daughter became upset! We were discriminated against and denied services. Then called the police!! AVOID THE PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!! This happened on 2/20/2015! Bad Doctor!!! Karma came back  and closed this place down! GOD DO NOT LIKE UGLY!",
