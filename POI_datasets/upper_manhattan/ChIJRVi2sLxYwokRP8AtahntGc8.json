James made sure I had a great car and he walked me over to -- that's service (and with his smile). Marcello was working the last time I was there and when I walked in the door -- it had been 3 months -- he greeted me by name, asked about my mother (who was with me last time) and even asked about a trip I had taken. Now THAT is amazing!! (I wish I had his memory!) I would give them both a raise to keep them happy -- you don't want to lose top-caliber people like Marcello and James!",
