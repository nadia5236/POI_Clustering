            "text": "I passed by this place multiple times and then decided to give it a shot. My experience was much worse than I expected. First of all, almost a half of washing machines and dryers are out of service. There are literally lines. Then the washing machine I was using stopped. I did not know that because I ran home to grab another load. When I was back, the lady in charge told me she added more soap and more softener, which did not ask. As a result, when the cycle finished, I still had bubbles on my clothes. So, I had to wash my clothes for the second time They also have this stupid system with money cards (no quarters, no debit/credit cards), and this cards do not work every time you insert it. I did insert the money card and picked the cycle, however, it did not start. I did not realize it, then the same laundry lady picked the hot temperature while I was removing the second load from the washing machine. I realized the disaster only while removing my clothes from the dryer. Obviously, some sweaters got destroyed. The lady refused to do the refund, and was terribly rude. I\u2019m giving this laundromat one star but I would love to have the option to give them a negative rating. I guess I should have read the reviews before I put my cloths in their washing machine. In total: I wasted more time than I expected, spent more money than I expected, and had some clothes destroyed. Part of it can happen any time you go to a laundromat, but again, you kinda expect to hear a simple sorry, which has never happened in this case.",

When I enter the location two person was entering their clothes in the washer, when the lady that work in the place,  Shout out to me screaming your are not going to wash clothes here. This made me realize racism still exists just because I am Latin she didn\u2019t allow me to wash clothes when two other person from a different races was entering their clothes. I told her I will speak with her manager and she said back with a nasty tone I could provide you with the number. Really have a smart mouth.\n\nReally unprofessional, I just want my money that\u2019s it inside the card cause I am not going to go back.",
