            "text": "No problem with 230 92nd but 240 92nd garage Never thought I\u2019d write a poor review for a company until this year. I\u2019ve parked with GGMC since 1997 which included at the time my new 2001 vehicle which I still have to this day. Never had any major issues until the summer of 2013 when a trainee had been parking my car.  I notice an issue with my armrest being bent out of place that made it difficult to open.  Although I did not report the incident at the time thinking it was an accident I returned to park in August. Upon picking-up my vehicle I got as far as 111 & Park Ave to open my armrest and it just FELL OFF onto the rear floor of my car. SO flabbergasted I did the following. 1. Perturbed I called the garage and the evening attendant recommended I speak to the day-time attendant to report the issue. 2. I left a message with upper management and HE DID NOT return my call at ALL. 3. The following morning I spoke to the day attendant and brought my console armrest lid to show him.  4. The day attendant gave me an incident form which he left blank.  After basically accusing me of breaking the console armrest off of my OWN vehicle?  The trainee's STATEMENT held more weight then the customer. BUT If the trainee knew of damage before the customer returned to get their vehicle, isn\u2019t the trainee basically admitting the damage was caused in the garages care? This experience has left a sickening feeling in my stomach.  I WILL NOT park my old/new vehicle at GGMC 92nd Street again!! CUSTOMERS BE AWARE: GGMC DOES NOT take responsibility for damage caused by their employees and truths are so prefabricated that common sense doesn\u2019t exist.  In the long run it will cost you more in time and money to repair GGMC attendant damage plus pay for the parking fee.",
