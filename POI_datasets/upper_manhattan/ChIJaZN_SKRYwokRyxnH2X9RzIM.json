He not only did a very thorough interview with us, but we could tell that he cared about us as a couple and wanted to make our day extra special. He used details we had forgotten we told him, was able to incorporate a cultural tradition and tailored the ceremony specifically for us! We have guests to this day that still say our ceremony was so personal and meaningful. Such a memorable part of the day. The list can go on, but the moment you speak to Mark you will instantly know that he can make your wedding day an unforgettable one! We cannot thank you enough for everything you did for us and for joining us together as husband and wife!",

When we met Mark, we knew why. His calming demeanor and professionalism helped guide us during this whirlwind time. We met in person and just talked -- about us, about our cat, something about football that I tuned out -- what it was was natural and easy. Over the course of several weeks we continued our conversations, we talked some more, filled out a questionnaire and then Mark got to work on his personalized ceremony. He took into consideration everything - things we didn't even consider - like the sensitivity of two faiths coming together and two cultures needing to find balance. He found that beautiful space within. The end result was a thoughtful and inspiring ceremony that joined our family and friends in the most compelling way. It was truly special to work with Mark and we highly recommend his services to any couple tying the knot.",
