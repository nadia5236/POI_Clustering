Great view from our seats. It\u2019s 5 min from the parking lot. Very accommodating to your meal. Food came in a timely matter and the music was great for the mood. I can\u2019t wait to come back. In hopes I get Demetra she was amazing. Super sweet and funny!",

            "text": "Piatto is in a prime location, in a neighborhood that went zero to fancy, real quick. It's got a beautiful view of the Manhattan Skyline and sharp decor. You can see into the kitchen area and watch your pizza being made in the brick oven. It's a solid setup.\n\nMy only issue was with the waitstaff at the time. It could be an anomaly. I hope it's an anomaly... One of our waiters was just a little bit curt/short. He was not necessarily rude but there was definitely a palpable edge to how he spoke (maybe it was his cadence too). It didn't help that one of our entrees was forgotten. \n\nDespite all of that, the food was really good. My squad is a fun bunch so small hiccups don't usually slow us down. Brunch ended on a positive note. \n\nBottome Line: I could probably be persuaded to try Piatto again. Hopefully, that one waiter wasn't a symptom of a larger work culture problem.",
