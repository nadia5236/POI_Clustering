They send the wrong item twice, and instead of sending the corrected item, they demand they get the incorrect item back first.  I then asked to speak to a manager, in which, I was told they would call me instead the following day.  I advised them of my hours to call, as I am in AZ, and they are in NY.   They called me at 6:25am, WAY before my time advisement.  The \"supervisor\" George, was the rudest person I have ever spoke with.  He could have cared less that he called me at 6:25am.   When I told him that calling someone that early is unacceptable, he started to become irate.  I told him his customer service was the worst, and I would reflect that in my amazon review, to which he snarked, Ohhh, I already read your review.   The conversation ended with him telling me to get a red wig, that I was an A__ clown, and accused me of stealing money from him.  DO NOT DO ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY.  CONSUMER BEWARE",
