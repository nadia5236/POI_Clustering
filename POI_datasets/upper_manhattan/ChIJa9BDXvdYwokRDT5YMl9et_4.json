From the moment he enrolled at CDC he was in the most wonderful hands. All the teachers, staff, and students are like one big family. Every child is taken cared of with lots of unconditional love. My son couldn't talk, walk, be in a room filled with people, nor communicate his wants or needs but with the help of every one at CDC he can do that and so much more. He now is going to big boy school (kindergarten) in September were he is excited to meet new friends and teachers. It's going to be hard to move forward for him but he will always remember everything they have taught him. I want to also take the time out to thank MS.Nichole Jablon for helping not only my son julius but also me as parent. Thank you for teaching and showing me how to be a better parent. Thank you for helping me better understand my sons needs and wants. Also for always being a big supporter of our little family. Also thank you to the blue room staff for always paying attention to every detail and helping julius grow. Thank you to Ms.Michele and Ms.Marianne (I hope the spelling is right) for having a open ear and open door policy for my son and our little family. Thank you to Ms.Denise for always putting a smile on our faces from the moment we walk into the door. You guys have significantly changed our lives in the most positive ways. We will never forget you guys \u2661 I will be forever grateful and thankful for all that you guys have blessed us with. \nPs. We can't wait for Juliet to start this September. Can't wait to start another chapter  of two years with juliet. I know she will be in the best of hands.",
