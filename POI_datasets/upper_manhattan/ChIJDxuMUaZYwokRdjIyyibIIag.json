Six weeks ago, I requested a copy of my records. I called after a couple of weeks and was told it could take 30 days, which seems like an absurd amount of time. When I called again after 5 1/2 weeks, I was told someone would call me back, which never happened. This morning I called and was told that they are awaiting approval and might send the records this week or next. After having delayed so long, I thought they might expedite the process, but it doesn't appear that they feel any urgency about this. There was no apology.",
