Walked into this store with my friend to receive assistance on her IPhone that she purchased from this boost mobile store. Josh (Hispanic lightskin dude with beard) who was at the front desk was not trying to help us to see what was the issue with the phone at all. He didn\u2019t take a look at the phone or even touch the phone to see what the problem was. As my friend is explaining it\u2019s not working and she got the phone from this store He told us there is nothing he can do about it & he doesn\u2019t provide any new SIM cards to those who already have a boost mobile plan call customer care. I asked why and he didn\u2019t answer I just thought it was weird because he didn\u2019t take a look at the phone and this is a boost mobile store , why don\u2019t you provide SIM cards ? Is he not a phone tech ? Why couldn\u2019t see if there is a technical issue? I asked if he has a manager or supervisor around he said there\u2019s no manager around and he doesn\u2019t know when he\u2019ll be around so I asked for a business card so my friend can come back and speak to the manager because she purchased this iPhone from this store and it sucks that she can\u2019t get any help to figure out what was wrong with it. He provided poor customer service he didn\u2019t want to give me his supervisor contact info He also wasn\u2019t making any eye contact at all with us and he continued to misgender my friend. A co worker luckily came in the store, stepped in the situation and actually helped us fix what was wrong with the phone & the issue was minor. I noticed he walked across the room once she stepped into the situation. I\u2019m not going to say don\u2019t come here because there are people that help you But Josh definitely discriminates against the lgbtq community and he\u2019s not someone to go to for any assistance \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08",
