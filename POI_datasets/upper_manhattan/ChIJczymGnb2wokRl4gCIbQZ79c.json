I had a baby tooth that was loose for a million years. Then it fell out, leaving me snaggled! (Of course, it was a tooth near the front.) Dr. Page fixed it with a bridge, and I could smile again. He and Simone, the hygienist have helped me keep my mouth in tip top shape. I am grateful.",

The office is close to major subway lines and there is also a bus stop directly across the street.\n\nThe office staff is very professional, courteous and genuinely cares about their patients.  I am always impressed when I visit the office that Dr Page seems to have the latest technology and new dental instruments.  I really like that after my dental cleanings that I am thoroughly examined by Dr Page, himself, and not an assistant.  \n\nHis hygienist, Simone, cannot be beat.  She's diligent, thorough and fun, too.  Gone are the days of employees who don't take pride in their work when it comes to this dental practice!  \n\nI would travel further than I do now to go to a dentist who doesn't attempt to \"sell you procedures\" that really are not required.  Or to go to one who doesn't bill things to  your insurance that weren't done.  Can we say Dr Page is honest?  YES!    \n\nI highly recommend you giving this office your trust and business for you and to your family.  I have visited when children are there.  They are leaving with smiles on their faces.  Obviously, Dr Page and his team know how to calm one's fears!    \n\nEnjoy your visits!\n\n",
