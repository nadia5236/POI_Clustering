            "text": "Incredibly disappointed. I have heard nothing but the best about this place and have been looking forward to taking class for awhile. \n\nI saw that you could drop in for $20 so I did. I have done my research, watched numerous videos of this technique and couldn't wait to get into class. \n\nThis is getting 2-stars because the place is simple and cute. But I wasn't paying to just go to a really cute place.\n\nThe instructor was just.... unbelievable. A good guy, I'm sure, but in no way qualified to teach this class. I, and one other girl, were new to this class. I understand the concept of this technique, but she had no clue what it was. The instructor couldn't explain how to execute any of the moves and didn't even know what muscles were being activated when asked by one of the other men that had come to the class before. \n\nTHESE ARE PEOPLE'S BODIES! You MUST know what you are working with!!! You are dealing with people's delicate bodies! Most importantly, if one of your clients says his foot is cramping, you do NOT say, \"Well (insert other client's name here) likes cramping so that's fine.\" He should have gotten an adjustment to help him. You do not continue executing a move if your body is cramping. It is trying to tell you something. \n\nFinally, one of the clients in the class had to get up and show the new girl how to execute the moves. He explained to her what she needed to do. At one point she said, \"You should teach the class.\" And I agree. He knew exactly how to break down the moves and what needed to happen in order to activate the right muscles. At the end of class he -- the same client -- inquired about how she find out about genius of flexibility, and asked why did she decided to come and what were her goals. I would've thought this man really was an instructor, but he wasn't. \n\nI'm in recovery from an injury right now and was hoping this would help me out a bit -- seeing as how my shoulders are really tight (my shoulder is what is recovering). But watching him deal with the new girl I was not going to dare ask a question just to have it not answered. \n\nSo, today, I got to pay $20 to essentially see a man get a workout for himself and not know how to explain Bob's brilliant concept to his paying clients. \n\nAbsolutely unbelieveable and disappointing. Hope everyone else's experience is better than mine.",
