Broadview Networks was my answer, I currently pay by month or have the option to do a year. Plus the bill is ALWAYS the same which is also huge, I hate when  they change from month to month. Deann came to my condo complex for a wine and cheese event and we had a great time. Thanks again Broadview Networks....I'm sold!",

I have always gotten a live representative who is quick to assess the situation and the tech support gets back to me pretty quickly with the diagnosis and fix.  They monitor it and actually call back even after the problem is fixed to make sure everything is okay.  I would not hesitate to give them a chance to see if they fit your needs.",
