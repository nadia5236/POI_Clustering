Pulled up about midway into the entrance to the lot and the rudest attendant I probably have ever come across in my 39 years as a New Yorker comes storming at my car and shouting at me. Apparently he wanted everyone rounding the corner outside the lot with about a dozen school buses pulling up to drop off children. Why? I have no idea as the entry way to this lot is humongous and can accommodate about a half dozen cars. Im not sure if he found his wife cheating on him the evening before and chose to come into work looking for a fight. I asked him why he simply couldnt ask me politely to pull my car back as I was unaware of his parking protocol in what he thinks is his personal lot but that seemed to trigger him further. He kept shouting obscenities at me and told me to get my car out of the lot if I didn't know what the F$#%K I was doing. BTW, my coworkers haven't faced that level of aggression but claim that the other sexist employees will constantly hit on them. Sorry for the rant but just needed to put this out there as I have been fuming all morning and afternoon. Do yourself a favor and park a block before in the other lot. The people who work there are sweethearts and don't seem to have the same issues controlling their aggressive and sexual impulses. Who the hell hires these people?",

I used a stling app where you pay online. He seemed very upset about it. I explained to him that I don't carry cash I use the app regularly. He said well if the lot if full and busy than I can't take it. I get it and that's completely understandable, but sir the tone of voice and time before 8am was unessesary.\n What does it matter if I have to go somewhere else? Or the app must refund my money because the lot is full. That's my business. I'll cross That bridge If i ever need to .\n\nIs my money not green? Is my credit card not plastic enough? \n I wish I could give it and him negative stars. \nPlease remember customer service counts for a great deal and goes a long way . There are PLENTY of garages around this area. I'll be sure to take my hard earned money elsewhere.",

Then, told me \"pull up your car there next time.\" with an attitude. He did not even say, \" how are you or good morning.\" He treated me as a kid with an attitude. I am 40 this year.. are you kidding me? \n I asked his name and manager's name. He said, \" I am Loui*. There is no manager and he is busy?\" Thank you for polite response.\nAnd he told me to stay in there because he needs to do his job, looking at my car and pointing out scratches. Lol!! I know that you are doing your job. The problem is... the way you are talking!!! It threw me to the roof in the morning. \nThen, I said \" thank you so much.\" And he replied to me \" bye!\"\nWow.... I never had this kind of experience in any of the places. Please avoid this place... there are tons of other parking garages around.\nSurprisingly,I found out that the guy was a manager.
