The grading distribution in this course is simply haphazard because who teaches it is a total slob. One should avoid this place at all costs. NYIT and Manhattan College are far superior in all engineering fields. Another point to note is that it is simply textbook cramming that ensures an A in all engineering courses-teachers are lazy, incompetent etc etc. Beware.",

There are professors who really care about what and how the students learn. But there are others who solely focus on their research work (which is great) and not focus on teaching well. That's not the motto of a good school. Teaching is an art, so is research - having someone be able to do both efficiently is rare. The building needs serious attention in terms of updating the elevators, classrooms, auditorium, lighting etc. etc. One last thing, students who want to become an engineer treasures this place a lot, I know I did. So, investing time and money in the student projects by AIAA, SAE, ASME, ANS, SWE, NSBE, Concrete Canoe etc. is very very important.",
