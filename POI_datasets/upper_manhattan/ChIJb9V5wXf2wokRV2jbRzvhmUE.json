            "text": "Mix of low income/rent stabilized and market rate apartments. The owners are forcing out the rent controlled residents (through tactics of not fixing heat, hot water or appliances and non action to poor living conditions) to \"upgrade\" the building and raise rental rates by 300%. I have one of the new apartments and it is beautiful, but living here is a nightmare. Don't be fooled by the interior renovations of the individual apartments. Its all smoke and mirrors. The \"security gates\" do not lock and are often tied open. The front door locks to the building are always broken so non residents are always wandering the grounds and inside the hallways, ransacking the lobby, gangs of teenagers in stairwells doing drugs. I was even assaulted in the elevator by a woman who got into the building (through broken gates and door locks) that threatened to kill me. Rather than help me, security mocked me as this crazed vagrant called me homophobic slurs.The police had to remove her to get a psychiatric evaluation because \"security\" was worhtess. The management treats all residents with disrespect. When you call for assistance you're on hold for hours. emails go unanswered. The only thing they care about is forcing the old residents out and collecting the highest rates they can from the new residents. They do not care about the condition of the property (rats, bugs, garbage) or the safety of the residents (they use pesticides in adjoining apartment that are infested without notifying the residents with common walls or in the same \"line\". I work nights and sleep days and have often woke up with my eyes and throat and skin burning from the fumes because they did not send notice of the fumigation in adjoining apartments). After months of complaining and multiple incidents including homeless people deficating in the elevators, drug parties directly outside my apartment door and other security violations the solution was NOT to fix the locks or even to add a guard at the front door as I requested, but rather to have their attorneys send me a certified letter denying all of my documented issues and telling me I should move if I don't like it here. NOT A SOLUTION as I just spent several thousands of dollars to move here in March 2018. Rather than honor their lease agreement they want ME TO LEAVE rather than honor the rental agreement. These people operate in BAD FAITH. Don't be fooled by the pretty finishes, this place is maintained and operated like a low income housing project. And its sad that the best 5 Star reviews on this sitter are from people like Iesha Smallwood, who work in the Management and Leasing Office.",

The floor is uneven in the livingroom and bathroom due to the flooding and water damage that happen in the unit. Water filled with fecal matter sat on top of the floor for over 4 hours - it took two porters and the super to clean the mess. And then almost 45 days for mgmt to come in and put band aid repairs on the flooring and toilet and tub. The bathroom doesnt properly circulated air - so the paint and bugs come into the bathroom often. The heat in the bedroom and living room didnt work for about 3 months out of the winter months. \nThe unit adjacent to the living room has loud dogs(3) that bark often and kitchen appliances that leaked thru the walls. I had over $1700 dollars worth of living room furniture damage. And super thankful for having renters insurance. Supposedly the building is going to give me back my deductible when they return security deposit but we will see. I was overcharged for rent for over 4 months as well. Make sure to file all compliments with DCHR and 311. Thats the only way they get things done hear. Also email - inf0@gfbmanagement - if you want anything answered or resolved. Roaches comes from the ceilings and compact chutes and I have killed over 120 roaches in the hallways. If you walk down the hallway to the unit you can see it. You know something has to be wrong- when the exterminator comes once week.",
