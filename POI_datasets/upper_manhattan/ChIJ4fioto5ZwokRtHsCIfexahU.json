I have been so impressed, time and time again, by the exceptional customer service I've received (from both of our reps: Kevin Strunk and Tracy Robertson). Response time is incredibly quick, communication is always clear and very thorough, and lead times are met. Any time we've had an issue on a project site (construction-related) and had to turn to Ferguson for a solution they have helped problem solve and have kindly expedited orders to accommodate our time constraints. There is honestly not a bad word I can say about my experiences. \n\nSpecifying and coordinating plumbing fixtures is not always very straightforward and the process lends itself to many questions on my end. Kevin has always responded with patience, knowledge and with options on how to solve my problem. I did not expect to have this experience when I first reached out to Ferguson...as many of these kinds of businesses don't offer this level of customer service. It was a pleasant surprise and I look forward to working with Ferguson for years to come.",

When the base did not arrive she then told me it would be delivered two weeks later. Those days came and went and I did not receive my shower pan or a phone call with an update.  Everything she have told me from the beginning did not occur, and the appropriate thing to do would have been to reach out to me immediately when the dates she stated were not met, not for me to have to continually contact the company.  In addition, after all my own efforts to get my shower pan delivered, when delivery arrived the wrong shower pan had been ordered.  It seems like she have dropped the ball every step of the way.",
