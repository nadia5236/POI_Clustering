I can't seem to get from them my husband and son their group# even though I am the one who insured them. They told me to tell them to call and when they call they give them the run around telling them they are not insured and should call my job healthcare rep. Then I call them and a rep tells me everybody is insured. Every time you call, every rep tells you a different story. You asked for a supervisor , they put you on hold for 20 mins then disconnect you. I get so stressed and tired no one in the family call anymore. The last straw- the doctor's office called to tell me today that I am the only one that is insured. Oh my God. Can it get any worse?. It is one of the most terrible  company I have ever dealth with. I am done.",
