The hotel was literally around the corner from the F train. Super convenient! We loved this place and will be back for sure.",

The interior was under renovation at the time, but the design choices I did see really reflected the surrounding lower-east neighborhood aesthetic very well. \n\nMy room on the 6th floor had a great skyline view, a real pleasure to drift off to each night and wake to in the morning. Although the room was NYC-size, I had everything I needed, no trouble sleeping thanks to the double-paned windows, and no problems to speak of.\n\nOutside, it's matter of steps to the subway, coffee, food choices, bodegas, you name it.\n\nAnd, everyone I spoke with at  the front desk was helpful, friendly, and welcoming.",

The check in wasn\u2019t until 3 but we were landing at the airport at 12:45 They made sure our room was ready when we got there. Which it was! We appreciated the hospitality. The room was very tight! BUT very clean! They accommodated us by bringing up a crib for our baby. When we go back to NY we won\u2019t mind staying there again. We were hardly in the room. We literally checked in-changed and left. We weren\u2019t back in the room until midnight. It wasn\u2019t noisy at all which was great.",
