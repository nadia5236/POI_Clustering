I show a picture of what I wanted to get done and explained how I wanted it several times. The owner really didn\u2019t pay attention to my requests and she was rude about it. After the hair was done I wanted pay but did not have any cash on me. On the website site it doesn\u2019t say cash only. When I called the day prior they never mentioned it. She said I should have expected to pay cash and that it is well known here. The thing is that I don\u2019t live in New York. I was visiting for the week. Where I live, people pay with cards and if it is cash only they will tell you upfront. Anyway she said I needed to leave something behind in order to get cash from the ATM. I only had my wallet and phone. She suggested that I leave my phone. I refused to that and asked that someone followed me to the ATM. After some back and forth and the owner being very rude to me and yelling at me in front of other customers, one of the ladies walks with me to the ATM and they are all laughing. \nThe hair that was done is not neat. I need to re-do it when I get home. What a waste of my time and money. \nNot to mention how dirty and unhygienic the place is. After dipping someone\u2019s braids in hot water, they do not change the water. They reboil and use the same water on someone else. The so same thing with towel and combs. \nThis is the worst hair braiding store I\u2019ve ever been to. And I\u2019m not one to complain",
