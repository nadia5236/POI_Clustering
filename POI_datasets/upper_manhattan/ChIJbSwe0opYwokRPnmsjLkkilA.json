He was trying to explain over her shouting that everything was out of stock (as it always is when you go into this post office). The woman shut him very quickly with her horrible, rude, attitude and finally gave him what he needed. She complained to me that I was using the last of her \"courtesy tape\". I told her that this was a post office! people buy boxes at the post office and need them taped! She was so rude, curt, and short with me. Horrible post office and horrible people working here.
