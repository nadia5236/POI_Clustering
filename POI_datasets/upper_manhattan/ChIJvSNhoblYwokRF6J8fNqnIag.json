What a delight this school is!!! DO NOT BELIEVE the naysayers that are all over this site rating the school badly.  The staff is young, interested, engaged & everything the \"better\" schools are not.  We are thankful every day that this type of school exists in the Catholic School network.  Wish there were more just like it as every family deserves this type of experience.",

            "text": "Wow is this a bad school. The administration is very very young and inexperienced. The teachers are younger and under paid so they live far far away from the pricey UES. The school is constantly shaking the tin cup for donations. They have a great sales pitch in the beginning but it wears out. The emperor has no clothes.  I'm a product of 12 years of Catholic schools too and this ain't one of them. The school made its bones on a favorable and now dated newspaper article. Save your money and go to PS 6 or PS 290 or spend real money and go to Trinity. This place is not what it appears to be. However, the deli on the corner is good and CVS is across the street. ",
