I have been a patient of Dr. Wicks for over ten years.  The office is warm and welcoming and the staff is always courteous and friendly.  Appointments are easy to make and adjust if needed.  Dr. Wicks is very knowledgeable and always takes time to explain each procedure.  My very first dental implant was done by Dr. Wicks, and it turned out great!  My mother and brother are also patients of Dr. Wicks based on the attentive care that he has taken with my oral health.   It can be daunting at times in the dental office and I am happy to say I always feel ease when I visit the dentist thanks to my experience with Dr. Wicks and his staff!",
