I am an adult student, I travel frequently so in addition to trying to a couple other studios in NYC I've tried several in other cities in the US and even a few abroad, so I feel I can say with some authority NOTHING COMPARES TO BALLET ACADEMY EAST. Seriously, the teachers here are phenomenal, they truly care, they don't treat you like an out of shape human in an ill fitting leotard (how I tend to feel in dance class) rather they treat you like their life depends on you learning how to dance correctly. You will get tons of feedback and corrections. The teachers explain and mark everything so you will never be confused or uncertain of how to dance. They have so many levels so you can be certain that so long as you attend a class at your level you will be able to do everything in that class (although it will certainly still be a challenge). Such a privilege to learn from these teachers.",

I enjoy the classes myself just for the exercise \u2014 trust me, I\u2019m no ballerina!  You can really work up a good sweat and burn some calories.  It keeps me more motivated and mentally challenged than just walking on a boring treadmill or elliptical.  The little kids look so adorable.  I also enjoy seeing the pre-professional dancers.  The training looks world-class at that level.  There are usually 5 different studios going so lots of different classes to choose from, depending on your particular situation.",
