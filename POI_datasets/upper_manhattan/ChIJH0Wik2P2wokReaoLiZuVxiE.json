I sat and waited 1hr 1/2 before being called. Once I was called the banker proceeded to tell me I couldnt not open my daughters account because I didnt have my green card with me even though I was already a customer of Chase and I've been with them for years. She even mentioned if I called the 1800 number they would tell me the same thing. So I went ahead and called and the reps there told me that is not one of their policies and they weren't aware of this. I then went back to the banker and explained to her what was told to me. She continued to insist that the reps at the 1800 number dont know what they are talking about and she cannot open the account. I no longer felt like fighting with them so I said ok and left.  Today I went to Chase on 55th St and 8th Ave and the banker there opened the account with no issues not once was I asked for my green card. They Staff at 55th and 8th Ave are very pleasant and patient. So thank you to the Chase  staff at 55th and 8th. I would never step foot in Chase at 144th and Broadway again even though it's a few blocks away from my house. They refuse to help the customers especially if it's near time to closing even if you were in the branch way before closing time. It's always long lines and they move like snails in peanut butter.",

They have a list that you must sign to see a banker but totally disregard it.  They will service a familiar face instead of honoring the sign in sheet that they themselves have placed.  It is very rude and disrespectful. I suggest that the branch manager give a class on customer service skills and the importance of honoring rules and regulations.",
