I called around for days and no one could do the job or offered a binding that was sub par and had to drop my own time off. I finally found Rug Wash. For the same price as competitors, Tim picked up the rug from my home, did a perfect job replacing the fabric border (like the original that was installed 15 years again from manufacturer) at a price that was on par with competitors offering a much lesser repair solution.... And he dropped it back off at my house on time. Highly recommended!",

            "text": "My girlfriend and I had just moved in together, and we had finally completed decorating or beautiful place. We had her family visiting from the East Coast, and had just finished dinner outside on our patio. I was carrying dishes in from outside, when I spilled water on our brand new 6 by 9ft living room rug. I immediately went into the kitchen to grab a towel to dry the water up, when I came back the dye from the rug started bleeding through. I totally freaked out because the blue dye was all over the place, and the rug had a huge dark stain from the spill. \u00a0This didn't go over so well with the Mrs, but hey, accidents happen right?! Well, this one sucked, and I took the rug all over town being told that there was really nothing they could do. I tried folding the rug up to expose only the stained part, as I left it outside all day so that the sun could fade it. It didn't work. Doghouse.. Well, I finally cried for Yelp, and the Rug Wash Inc was the light at the end of the tunnel. \u00a0I came by and was greeted by a lovely receptionist who introduced me to Joe. \u00a0He was honest and completely straight forward, stating that they could do their best but that it would take some time and that he couldn't promise anything with how much damage there was. I said let's do it.\nThey emailed and called me each week with an update to let me know how thing's were going. Barry explained that they would be washing the entire rug several times to get the chemicals out, and then treat it to try and regain the same color as the rest of the rug.\u00a0\nA few weeks later I received the call that they could come and deliver the rug, and that I would be very happy with the results. To be honest, when they arrived I had doubts, but the moment I saw the rug I was ecstatic and was so pleased with how it turned out. Joe explained to me that it was really tough to remove the stain, but that they were able to even things out after the third wash and finally get it to blend with the rest of the rug.\u00a0\nMy lady was so excited that 1. there was finally a rug again in the living room, and 2. that it looked almost exactly like how we purchased it. Thank you again Rug Wash for all that you and your team have done. A 100% satisfied customer.",

After years looking for a trustworthy place to repair and wash my rugs I found this fabulous company that gave us the instant trust and the best deal in town. My rugs had not been washed for years and needed lots of repairs. Today I got my 5 rugs back all repaired to the perfection and washed so well that they are literally like brand new and more importantly no one can beat their prices. I highly recommend this company and guarantee that you will have the biggest smile when they bring back your rugs.",
