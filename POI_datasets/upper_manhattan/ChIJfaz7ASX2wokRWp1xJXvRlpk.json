For $25, I received a USB-C cable but the piece of garbage is thin and only useful for downloading pictures or slow, 8 hour, overnight charging.  The thin charging cable charges my phone painfully slowly, even when I've plugged the thin cord to a 2 mAh or 3 mAh charger.  When I plugged in their thin cord, my phone said that it was going to take >3 hours to charge from 60% to 100%.  I should have suffered until I could buy a decent cord from Best Buy or OfficeMax for the same price.",
