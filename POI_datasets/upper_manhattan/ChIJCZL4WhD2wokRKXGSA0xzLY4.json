I ended up having to get in contact with the manager who attempted to help but took him several attempts and more of my obnoxious calling to get an effort in the end. after two months of trying persistently I finally got my clothes back. If it wasn't for one of the shirts being one of my favorites, I probably would've gave up along time ago. even those the closest drycleaner to my apartment, I'll never use them again.",
