She began training my puppy when she was about 4 months old and immediately understood her personality -- it took me much longer to realize many of the traits that she noticed.  Mia absolutely loves her and training sessions are fun -- we both enjoy them immensely.  Lauren is very professional and is a wonderful resource for all dog-related matters -- she has excellent suggestions for everything from dog-walkers and dog-sitters to toys and nutrition.",

            "text": "We could not say enough positive things about The Peaceful Dog. We first met Lauren, the owner, when our dog Gus wants about 3 months old. We used her extensively for training, and Lauren was exactly what we needed as new dog owners. She is incredibly knowledgeable about animals -- from training and behavior to nutrition and health. Today Gus is 4 1/2 and we frequently use Lauren for pet sitting and training. He has such a love for Lauren and an incredible reaction to her every time he sees her.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion we were on vacation out of the country and Lauren identified a problem with our dog (which we probably wouldnt have), took him to the vet and turned out he needed emergency surgery. We felt exceptionally confident that he was in good hands, and she carefully led him through surgery and recovery until we were able to get home.\r\n\r\nGus is perfect today and loves spending time  with Lauren. We never feel guilty going away and leaving him with Lauren as we know he considers it to be such a treat -- like summer camp! And he always comes back to us happy and better behaved!",

Lauren exhibits great empathy for dogs and the owners who love them. She can take a stressful time and find ways to give dogs structure and balance and owners peace and, occasionally, quiet. Her advice is clear and always focused on helping our pets to behave at their best.",
