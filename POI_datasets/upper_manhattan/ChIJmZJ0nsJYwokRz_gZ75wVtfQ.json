Then I decided to do some research on how the auto transport industry works and learned that they are brokers that work on your behalf on securing a driver.  Reading through the negative reviews I realized that there are a lot of instances that can go wrong such as surprise fees, up charges, and unpredictable delivery/pickup times.  I found Auto Shippers Express through Angie's List and saw that they did not have any negative reviews.  I called and talked with Mike Price.  He was very transparent and honest with the complete process and provided me a quote.  He was able to secure a driver for me in just a few days.  During the entire process, he would call and keep me up to date.  The car was delivered ahead of schedule.  I am very pleased with this company and would highly recommend them!",
