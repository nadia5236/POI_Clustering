My brother was picked up from the funeral home that held him hostage  brought back to Unity and laid to rest with dignity as he should have been.  \n\nI suggest you speak with Mr. James the owner of Unity Funeral Chapels. He along with his staff gave our family respect, dignity and pride in ha\u00f1dling a very difficult process..Had he not stood up for our family in such a sensitive time of need we'd been humiliated and financially exhausted.  \n\nSo you see I can't share those same views because as a former director (which they didn't know) myself I was given the respect and help all families should have when putting the care of their loved ones in Unity's hands. On behalf of those Funeral Chapels who aren't that way... I am sorry your experience  was so mishandled...",
