Their hours are pretty good (for a bank) and they also have notary services for chase customers which is great. \n\nThe only issue is the security of the ATMs at night. One night my friend was pulling out cash and there was a shady person who was loitering in the ATM area who kept asking her for money. She was alone and felt threatened so she gave him money and left.",

The older light skin lady with glasses that sits in the front called me over, i explained the situation and she just stated she won\u2019t do it because it was in the terms and conditions and it was not a discretionary thing she could refund which is incorrect. She did not look at my account or anything. I called customer service after and got the fee waived. I\u2019m not complaining about chase bank but just the level of service this branch provided which was impersonal and did nothing to deepen any relationship.",

I'm not advocating that he is required to help me in any circumstance, but a good service who've led him to at least show some effort to help, especially when it was so clear that he was not attending anyone or was busy.\n\nIf you are looking for a service, don't go here. There are many other branches nearby that are way superior than the branch here. Chase is known for their superior employees with exceptional levels of service.....NOT HERE.
