            "text": "Both my children attended Harlem Link Charter School. My son who is in 8th grade and my daughter who is in 5th grade which is her last year at Harlem Link. No school is perfect which Harlem Link has have it's ups and downs however I have seen Harlem Link grown \"academy and physically\" especially with the big moved that happened over the 2018 summer and is getting better in the 8yrs I have been there as parent. As parent no can speak up for your child then you. I have seen alot of Harlem Link staff go above and beyond for the children and their parents because they want to see the children succeed in Life for example teachers have picked up children from their home when their parents were unable to get their children to school, if children are out for a lengthy period time for whatever the reasons, classwork and homework are sent home to make sure children don't miss anything while they're out. You don't have to live in the district for child to go Harlem Link which is a District 3 school but if he or she does attend Harlem Link he or she will get into a District 3 Middle School. One of the other thing that I LOVE about Harlem Link is the Start to Finish program which is a very big help, just because your child/children graduated from Harlem Link doesn't mean that where it ends \"oh no buddy\" they help you and your child/children with applications for High School, College, Internships, Scholarships and different programs just to name a few and from the minute your child/children attend Harlem Link Colleges are been talked about because all of classes are name after Colleges that the teachers attended.",
