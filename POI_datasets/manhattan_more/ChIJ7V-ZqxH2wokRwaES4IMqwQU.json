The chicken is crispy but not too greasy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle is light and fluffy. Utter perfection. The first time I went, the black-eyed peas were phenomenal: zesty and buttery at the same time, but the second time they were missing that tangy flavor...They could work on consistency.

It seemed like every time we looked up or away from the table, one of the 2 male servers were looking at us or asking us if they could take a plate. It was a little annoying, but not terrible. \n\nThere are two bathrooms in the back area that are somewhat small, but this restaurant is very accessible.",

And I had to get the half and half.  Everything was great and the food was reasonable priced.   I wish I had some of this food now to eat!! I would love to go back!!",
