( I copied and pasted from website). When I received the order there were no sausages or wedges. The food that was provided was, the lobster tails. Corn, broccoli, and shrimp. Although the food was good ( the corn was the best of it all) , it was very disappointing to have not received all of the order that was advertised. My hubby called me while at the counter, as i requested, to make sure he was able to order exactly what i wanted. I literallly had the website open and read him the menu as advertise. The employee was absolutely unaware of what the special including, however, i was confident that the cook would get the order correct. This such a turn off from this location. I will go back to Co op City's and Cross County's locations.",
