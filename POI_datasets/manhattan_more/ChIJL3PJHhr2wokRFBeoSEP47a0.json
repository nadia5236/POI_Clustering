The Staff doesn't show any sympathy or empathy for clients. This place should be investigated fully how clients are treated. On Wednesday it's food  pantry for the community and staff are giving to friends , family, and causing confusion resulting in fist fights. People are coming with numerous Identification cards that belongs to other people retrieving numerous tickets and receiving tons of groceries that should be intended for other people. This is unacceptable this is why it so chaotic and you can't receive a ticket.  The rule should be one ticket for whoever comes in person.why should anyone receive numerous tickets if they aren't present? ., this an absolute disgrace . I'm requesting this food pantry be under investigation for non compliance of food pantry codes rules and regulations.\n    This food pantry is mishandling these services for far to long and this must immediately stop and some rectification needs to be put in place. The Staff that are in charge are clueless they're running on  one wheel. I'm very disappointed how things are going on at this establishment.  SHAME ON YOU'LL FOR CAUSING  AN  UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR CLIENTS.",
