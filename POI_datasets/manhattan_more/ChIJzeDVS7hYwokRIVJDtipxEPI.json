I am an Executive in NYC and was trying to look the part of the technology companies I was leading, however I had no idea what I was doing. \nAmanda looked through my wardrobe (this is the toughest part) and got rid of a lot of things that just didn't make me feel or look good. \n\nAmanda then shared with me a simple vision...a few new functional items of clothing, a couple new pairs of shoes, some sport coats (with pocket squares!) and some new glasses and a haircut. I cannot thank her enough for literally transforming me. It was an amazing, yet subtle, transformation and everywhere I go people compliment me on my new look. I feel better about how I look and how I feel. I never knew how much a few good pairs of jeans, shoes and new glasses could change my life.\n\nI would recommend Amanda to anyone and everyone who is looking to make simple changes in your life to look and feel better!",

            "text": "My husband surprised me with a Christmas gift of a personal styling session with Amanda. I have to say that it is one of the best presents I have ever received. I left NYC a brand new woman. Amanda consulted with us a few times before we even left for NYC and had a really good idea of who I was and what I needed from her. She met us at our hotel to take a look at my wardrobe and give us an even better idea about what to expect and we started our shopping spree from there. We just recently found out we were pregnant (our first). Amanda gave me lots of advice about how my body would be changing and how dresses are going to be my go-to for a while. She is not shy about telling you what works and what doesn\u2019t work for you. She instinctively knows what types of things to pull for you to try on. She listens really well, makes you feel comfortable, and follows up to make sure you are happy. I would recommend Amanda to anyone. She is a master stylist. She also hooks you up with her amazing hair and makeup stylist who completes the look. We plan to come back after baby.",
