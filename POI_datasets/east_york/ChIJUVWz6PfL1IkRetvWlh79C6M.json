Jess the woman who was working at the time helped us find exactly what we needed to fit our needs. She helped to guide us to the products she believes would best fit us and were affordable. She knew exactly what she was talking about and made sure we were educated on the products we were buying. We spent over 45 minutes in the store and she was so kind through out the whole visit. We couldn't believe the customer service we received it was unbelievably amazing. 100% i would recommend this location and if you ever run into her she's such a kind hearted woman!",
