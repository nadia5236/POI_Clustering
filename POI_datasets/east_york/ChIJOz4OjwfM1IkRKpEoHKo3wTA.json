After meeting Richard (at the recommendation of a friend who comes in from Richmond Hill to see him) during my initial consultation I got a sense that he could be a guide/partner in my healing journey. \n\nSo I've been seeing him since the beginning of the year (? I can't recall exactly when, late spring maybe) and he has been instrumental in helping me deal with my health issues that go beyond the physical. It is true that alternative medicine helps deal with the person as a whole rather than just a symptom of disease. \n\nAlso, I was weary about osteopathy because I had seen the practitioner at East Toronto Osteopathy and she hurt me so much I was literally crying when I left her office. I could barely put my shoes on. I should never have paid her. \n\nRegardless, after speaking to Steve, I decided to give it another try and am so glad I did. Osteo provided the relief I've been looking for that no RMT has been able to give me. He even helped my sis in law after I mentioned she should go see him. \n\nIf you're dealing with health issues, take care of yourself and go see the team at Simple Cures. Find out for yourself. \n\nPS. I moved to Yonge and Sheppard and I drive all the way to the Beaches once a week to see them.",
