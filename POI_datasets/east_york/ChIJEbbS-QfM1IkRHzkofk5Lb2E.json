I told told him it was my first time and sent in some reference pics of what I wanted. I was so nervous I didn't know what to expect.\n\nI was FLOORED with how smooth everything went. It was a fantastic experience. I felt well taken care of and informed from beginning to end. JJ was patient and answered all of my questions. The shop had a very cool vibe, from the BOMB music in the background, the friendly conversation from the artists, the cool pictures on the wall, I could go on an on. My first tattoo came out perfect! I definitely will be going back for my second and maybe third : D\n\nThanks JJ, you guys rock!",
