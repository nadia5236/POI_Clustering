The program was well structured and well thought out and provided me everything I needed to get started and find my way into this magical new world of music production that I stumbled on. They really break down all the basics of what you need to know in a very hands-on setting and supportive teaching style. And the physical space itself is very well set up and inspiring!",

The instructors Chel and Erik are really awesome, down to earth and friendly individuals who teach with passion! The course takes on a maximum of 5 students which is amazing because it makes for a much more intimate learning experience. The space is also very warm, welcoming, and inspiring. Highly recommend you take this course if you've been thinking about DJing and want to learn! You won't regret it. Thank you Off Centre! :D",
