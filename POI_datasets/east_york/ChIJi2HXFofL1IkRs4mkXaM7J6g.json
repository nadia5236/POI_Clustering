They close at 3, but when I came in, it looked like they were closed already.\n\nAt the counter was a man counting money, who greeted me with an icy cold stare of death haha I get that he was counting, and didn't want to lose count, but you shouldn't be closing till until you're actually closed. He didn't say anything to me at all, yet throughout the entire time I was there, I could feel he hated me for coming in . _ . \n\nI get it, it is the long weekend, they want to get out and do their own thing. But if you're open till 3, then I shouldn't feel guilty for coming in before 3.\n\nA friendly woman from the kitchen comes out to greet me, and I tell her I was hoping to grab a latte. She tells me the machine has already been shut down, so I'm offered cold brew instead. Their cold brew is - amazing-so I happily excepted. But I guess I just still left feeling like, my business didn't matter as much is all :-\\",

The coffee and tea is excellent, the brunch nicely prepared with reasonable portions (though my duck egg was overcooked, a common issue with them). The service was superb, friendly and warm, and given the whole floor was run by one server! What a champ!",
