She also gave me some great advice on how to prevent my condition in the future which I thought was great! After the long day, on my way home, I lost my prescription and they promptly sent me another one with no fuss! I highly recommend this clinic!

            "text": "I strongly advise AGAINST seeking medical care in this clinic. In 2019 I started having recurrent throat infections and decided to make an appointment in meoclinic because they took throat swabs, unlike many other doctor practices in Berlin (which should be a routine, easy method to identify infection type-bacterial or viral. So that the correct type of antibiotics can be prescribed (or none in case of a viral infection)\nHere are few issues this place does not realize it has:\n1. No doctor\u2019s fee is disclosed. \nI believe the staff is advised not to give any doctor's-fee information, in case the bill turns out to be higher than previously told. However, this is exactly the red flag, if you need to worry about how much you will pay. They are too expensive.\nIncluding the throat swab test, ultrasound of the sinuses and doctor \u2018s fee I ended up paying 295-350 euros in each visit. Each visit was max 10 minutes with the doctor! \nFor any consultation from another doctor, they want to charge you double.\n2. Mistakes are overlooked and no after care is provided\nThey prescribed me the wrong antibiotics the first time. No one called me after 5-7 days to tell me to stop taking the wrong medication. I only found out in my second visit, when I booked another appointment because I did not get any better, another doctor told me about the results and they just kept charging me the same amount of fees, including the making an appointment fee! \nMoreover, although the doctor wanted me to give them a call if I did not get better, the staff ignored the urgency of my situation and were disinterested in taking messages and tried to persuade me to make an appointment (the clinic makes money by it). Apart from this important move on their part, they are very unfriendly. \n3. Test results were also overlooked and some came back stating that the material (from the swab) was not enough for further testing!\n\nThe above mentioned 3 issues continued for about 6 weeks. There was no apology, no reimbursement of any failed test or attempt.",

I became ill while traveling in Berlin from the USA. I called and made a same day appointment. From the receptionists' to the doctor herself; everyone was extremely friendly and sincerely caring. The doctor was extremely thorough and we sat face to face at her desk to discuss my illness and for her to take notes before moving to the table to perform some medical procedures. I would love for the USA to adopt this type of service experience. Thank you so much!",
