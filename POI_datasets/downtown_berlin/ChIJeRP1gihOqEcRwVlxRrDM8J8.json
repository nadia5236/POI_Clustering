However, MyDriver waited 3 weeks to process the payment, so by the time they got around to it, the notice I gave to my bank expired and the payment was rejected.  At first, MyDriver suggested I provide a different form of payment, which I was happy to do, only to tell me a day later that this was not an option, and that I had to cancel my booking and make a new one.  What they didn't mention to me was that the prices since have gone up by a whopping 50 euros (and they were not cheap to begin with)!  I was told it was due to EuroCup, even though our trip originated after the EuroCup was over.  When I asked to give me the old rate, given that I would have had it were it not for the payment difficulties, I was rather rudely told that it was my fault.  I ended up canceling my booking and getting 5 last-minute train tickets out of Paris and 2 hotel rooms in downtown Paris for  less money than MyDriver wanted for a 1-hour trip!",
