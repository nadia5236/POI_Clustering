I believe that the hotel is too large for its own good. Prices was very good when I was there and well worth it. There are more cosy hotels in Berlin than this. Good parking house just behind the hotel with direct entrance. Not the kindest service when paying the bill and needed to discuss over a 10 EUR payment for food that was included in the price. Needed 20 min to sort it out.",
