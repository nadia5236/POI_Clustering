So if I have several than I have to make several appointments otherwise other people will have \u2018to wait for months\u2019. It was difficult for me to choose what I wanted to talk about because when I made the appointment I had one problem but when the time came I already had 2 because I caught a cold.\n3) I said that I have coughs. The doctor replied that she can\u2019t talk with me about my cold and recommend anything because she\u2019s on the 8th month of pregnancy and she might get infected. She also said that I would have to make another appointment. I asked if it\u2019s normal that I had waited for two weeks and would have to wait more, and received a straightforward answer \u2018yes\u2019, which sounded very rude to me. \n4) Then a nurse came and made another appointment for the next Friday (in one more week!!) however with a better time for me. I also asked if I should make several appointments because I had several issues to talk about but the nurse said to me that my problems could be solved in just one appointment (which is now difficult to believe in).\nHope I\u2019ll find some other doctor before then.",
