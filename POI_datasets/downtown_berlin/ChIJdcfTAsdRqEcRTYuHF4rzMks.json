Why do you need to pay 50 Euro cent just to wash your hands or when you really need to do your business? Come on. I do not know any other restaurants that charge you to use their toilet facilities. You are paying the food and the drinks, but why charge people for their bodies necessary release of waste? It is ridiculous. Other than that, the ribs were delicious for a good reasonable price. ;) Highly recommend that one.",

            "text": "Terrible experience from a tourist's point of view, which is bad for business, considering this restaurant gets a lot of tourists from the historic Brandenburg Gate being nearby. We stopped here for lunch on a weekday, wasn't very busy. We had just sat down and started looking at the menus when our waiter asked us what we wanted to order. I asked for another minute and he scoffed and walked off. We really only needed an extra minute or so to look at the options they had, especially since it was our first time there, but he didn't return for another 10 minutes (during which time he was mostly standing around or walking past our table to chat up other customers). Upon returning, he asked if we were finally ready to order. When I said yes, he sighed and said, \"finally, good\" while taking out his pen and paper to write down our orders. The food was fine, we both enjoyed it, but the menu's English descriptions could use some work since our meals weren't exactly as we expected. But that wasn't the main issue. Our waiter's rudeness continued when I went to pay. Our total came out to 26 euro - I handed him 30 euro. He asked me, \"how much do you make?\" I didn't really know how to answer this. Being from America, people don't just randomly ask you how much money you make, it's kind of a rude question. But I realize I'm in another country so I didn't want to be offended, because their culture is probably different. Before I could even respond to the question, he added, \"The total is without tip. How much would you like to tip?\" I currently live in Ireland, where tipping isn't really a thing in restaurants since their staff get paid fair wages, and so nobody expects a tip or even asks for it. Hell, even in America people don't ask for tips - they expect them because they rely on them as part of their income, but they don't ask because it's a choice the customer makes on their own, not something they should ask for. So when he asked me how much do I want to tip, I felt a little conflicted, but went with my initial feeling which was to tip. I told him, \"3 euros.\" He repeated it back, \"3 euros?\" in a questionable tone, as if that wasn't acceptable. Then he added, \"So your total is 26, 3 for the tip... so you get 1 euro back?\" in a questionable tone again, so I just answered, \"Yes.\" He then began to dig through a little sack he had with coins in it and proceeded to hand me 70 cents in mostly 10s and a couple of 5s. He said, \"I don't have enough\" and dismissed himself to return to his work. I was baffled - there were a lot of coins rustling around when he was fetching the change, I'm sure he had enough to give me the proper amount back. But I didn't push it, we just left because we were fed up from the whole experience of being there. We would not go back to this restaurant, even though the food was good, because the service was rude and unwelcoming.",
