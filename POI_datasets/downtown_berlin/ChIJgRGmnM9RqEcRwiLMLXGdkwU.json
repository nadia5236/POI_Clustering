We've booked the family room, but could only move in from 2pm to 6pm, other hours should be paid 15euro. Our room was nice, but had no mirror and garbage bins inside, so we had to go out to the restroom only where all those things were. Kitchen was extremely small with no spoons and forks but plates and cups. While washing dishes I was hitting my head with some other shelves that small it was. While paying they didn't have change also :/ Overall, it was okay but too expensive for the night in such a place.",

It is awkwardly placed on a floor in a residential apartment block. \nThe only good thing is the location near the gate and a supermarket.\nSome of the issues that we encountered:\n- The staff speak limited english and are often not very friendly. \n- We had a room of 6 and were only given one key.\n- Reception is not always manned, therefore if you need something/help you have to wait around or all them somehow and us travelling abroad without a local sim made this very challenging.\n- The 'common room' is only 3 tables and 6 chairs made from very cheap plastic, therefore only a few people can use the area at one time.\n- We were playing cards in the 'common room' and were told very rudely to be quiet at 7pm when quiet time is stated from 10pm. When trying to discuss this point with the staff they just walked off.\n- Only 2 people can fit in the kitchen/laundry at a time. \n- The room wifi didn't work for the whole floor, therefore we had to use their alternative wifi which was very, very slow and kept dropping out.",
