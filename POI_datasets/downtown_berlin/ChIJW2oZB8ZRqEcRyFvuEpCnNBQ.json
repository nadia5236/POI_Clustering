My eldest asked lots of questions which made me happy that she was trying to take it all in. Well worth a visit. \n\nWell done Germany for acknowledging your / our past",

There's a cheap audio guide which can be purchased at the beginning of the tour and it is a 100% worth it. As you go through the museum and listen to the guide you get to explore different aspects of the Holocaust and the victims, sometimes even on an individual level, are always in focus. It is both an informative museum with loads of pictures, recordings and data, as well as a breath taking art piece consciously designed to honor the victims and spread a message of peace. Easily worth spending at least an hour here. If you're in Berlin, definitely take a look.",

Kids, and adults alike love it! It is photogenic and a rather unique touch for the 3 million victims. It may look steely and coffin like\u2026 but a lot of people were playing hide and seek. It is an important reminder but also confusing as it\u2019s not meant to have symbolic significance. But everything is open to interpretation. Make sure to visit!
