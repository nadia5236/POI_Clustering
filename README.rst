python-google-places
=======================

.. _introduction:

**python-google-places** provides a simple wrapper around the experimental
Google Places API.


Installation
-----------------

.. _installation:

pip install https://github.com/slimkrazy/python-google-places/zipball/master

OR

pip install python-google-places

Download source and then:
python setup.py install


Prerequisites
-----------------
.. _prerequisites:

A Google API key with Google Places API Web Service and Google Maps Geocoding API activated against
it. Please check the Google API console, here: http://code.google.com/apis/console
