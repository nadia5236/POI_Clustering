git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>

To ensure that your local repo. matches the github repo. just run git status, check and see if any files have been modified, deleted, or added. 
If so, then you can stage those files to be commited.

To stage a file(s) to be commited, I typically use

git add <rel_path_to_file> (for each file that is to be changed or added) followed by a

git commit -m 'your commit message'

then when you're through staging the files that you'd like to commit, or telling git what you want to change in the github repo 
and what note to leave when you change it, just run 

git push
